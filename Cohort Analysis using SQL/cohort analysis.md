# Cohort Analysis using Snowflake SQL Queries

In this analysis, we perform cohort analysis on different variables such as invoices, customers, and revenues using Snowflake SQL queries. We use a retail dataset and focus on various cohort-related metrics.
  The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo").

## Introduction

Cohort analysis is a powerful technique that allows us to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior and business performance by organizing customers into groups based on a common characteristic or event. These groups, or cohorts, are usually formed based on the timing of a specific event, such as the customer's first purchase. By analyzing how cohorts of customers behave over time, we can identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in customer engagement and revenue generation.

The retail dataset we use in this analysis consists of various attributes such as `InvoiceNo`, `CustomerID`, `InvoiceDate`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, and more. By leveraging this dataset and Snowflake's SQL capabilities, we aim to answer key questions related to customer behavior and business success. Our cohort analysis involves categorizing customers into cohorts based on their first purchase month, and then observing their subsequent activities over a predefined period.

## Purpose of Analysis

The primary objectives of our cohort analysis are as follows:

1. **Customer Retention:** We want to understand how well our business is retaining customers over time. By tracking cohorts of customers and their subsequent purchases, we can measure the percentage of customers who continue to make purchases after their initial transaction.

2. **Revenue Trends:** We seek to uncover revenue trends within different cohorts. This involves analyzing how the revenue generated by each cohort changes over subsequent months following the initial purchase.

3. **Customer Lifetime Value:** Our analysis aims to compute the customer lifetime value (CLV) for each cohort. CLV provides insights into the long-term value each cohort contributes to the business.

## Cohort Analysis on Order Level

The first cohort analysis focuses on order-level cohort analysis. We calculate the number of invoices for each cohort of customers based on their first purchase month.

```sql
-- Create a new database named SALES
CREATE DATABASE SALES;

-- Switch to using the SALES database
USE DATABASE SALES;

-- Create a new schema named COHORT_ANALYSIS
CREATE SCHEMA COHORT_ANALYSIS;

-- Switch to using the COHORT_ANALYSIS schema
USE SCHEMA COHORT_ANALYSIS;

-- Create a table named RETAIL with various columns to store retail data
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE RETAIL (
    InvoiceNo varchar (10),
    StockCode varchar(20),
    Description varchar(100),
    Quantity number(8,2),
    InvoiceDate varchar(25),
    UnitPrice number(8,2),
    CustomerID number (10),
    Country varchar(25)
);
SELECT * FROM RETAIL LIMIT 5;
```

## Order Level Cohort Analysis Table Explanation

- **FIRST_PURCHASE_MONTH:** This column indicates the month in which a cohort of customers made their first purchase.

- **'Month_0', 'Month_1', 'Month_2', ..., 'Month_12':** These columns represent the subsequent months following the customers' first purchase. For instance, 'Month_0' corresponds to the same month as the first purchase, 'Month_1' corresponds to the first month after the first purchase, 'Month_2' corresponds to the second month after the first purchase, and so forth.

- **Values in the Table:** The numbers in each cell of the table reflect the count of invoices (transactions) carried out by the customers within the specific cohort during the corresponding month. For instance, if there is a value of 1,701 in the first row under 'Month_0', it means that the cohort of customers who made their initial purchase in December 2010 conducted 1,701 invoices (transactions) within the same month.

The cohort analysis serves as a powerful tool for comprehending customer behavior over time. When observing the table, several observations can be made:

- **Cohort December 2010 ('Month_0'):** This cohort exhibited a substantial number of invoices (1,701) during their first month, which then gradually declined over the subsequent months.

- **Cohort January 2011 ('Month_0'):** This cohort initiated with 545 invoices in the first month, followed by a downward trend in the subsequent months.

- **Cohort February 2011 ('Month_0'):** In the initial month, this cohort recorded 473 invoices, displaying a pattern similar to that of the January cohort.

... and so forth for the other cohorts.

By thoroughly analyzing this cohort table, valuable insights into customer behavior can be uncovered. These insights encompass identifying patterns of repeat purchases, discerning shifts in retention rates over time, and recognizing which cohorts are more likely to generate higher transaction volumes. This collection of information can offer significant insights into business performance and aid in informed decision-making for devising effective customer engagement and marketing strategies.

## Cohort Analysis/Customer Retention Analysis on Customer Level

The following table presents the results of a cohort analysis focusing on customer-level retention. This analysis calculates the count of distinct customers within each cohort based on their first purchase month and subsequent months.

### Interpretation of the Table

- **Cohort:** This column displays the cohort's first purchase month, indicating the period when customers made their initial purchases.

- **Month_0, Month_1, ..., Month_12:** These columns represent the subsequent months after the customers' first purchase. For instance, "Month_0" signifies the same month as the first purchase, "Month_1" refers to the first month following the first purchase, and so on.

- **Values in the Table:** The numbers in each cell represent the count of distinct customers who made purchases during the corresponding cohort month and subsequent months. For example, the value 945 under "Month_0" in the row corresponding to the cohort of December 2010 means that there were 945 distinct customers who made their first purchase during that month.

### Observations

- **Cohort of December 2010 (Month_0):** This cohort started with 945 customers in its first month, and the number decreased in subsequent months. For instance, the count in "Month_1" dropped to 358, and it continued to decrease over time.

- **Cohort of January 2011 (Month_0):** In this cohort, 419 customers made their first purchase in January 2011. The count decreased as the months progressed, showing a typical retention pattern.

- **Cohort of February 2011 (Month_0):** With 380 customers making their first purchase, this cohort experienced a similar retention trend as the previous cohorts.

- **... and so on for other cohorts.**

### Insights

By analyzing this cohort table, businesses can gain insights into customer retention patterns. For instance:

- Understanding the percentage of customers who remain active in subsequent months after their first purchase.
- Identifying cohorts that exhibit high or low retention rates.
- Adjusting marketing strategies and engagement initiatives based on cohort behavior.

This analysis provides valuable information for optimizing customer engagement, retention strategies, and marketing efforts, ultimately contributing to business growth and customer satisfaction.

## Cohort Analysis on Number of Revenue

Cohort Analysis on Number of Revenue examines how revenue generated by different customer cohorts changes over time. Cohorts are categorized by their first purchase month, and subsequent monthly revenue is calculated. The outcomes are typically showcased in a table, illustrating revenue generated by each cohort in each month. This analysis helps uncover trends like initial spending spikes, revenue declines, or consistent growth. The insights gained can shape strategies to retain declining cohorts or capitalize on successful ones. It's a valuable tool for revenue optimization, tailored marketing, and enhancing customer lifetime value based on revenue patterns across distinct cohorts.

## Cohort Analysis on Number of Revenue

- **Cohort:** The leftmost column represents the cohorts, segmented by the month in which customers made their first purchase.

- **Months (Columns):** The subsequent columns labeled 'Month_0' through 'Month_12' represent the months after the first purchase month, with 'Month_0' corresponding to the month of the first purchase, 'Month_1' corresponding to the first month after the first purchase, and so on.

- **Values:** The values in the table represent the total revenue generated by each cohort in the respective months.
  - For instance, the value 66,676 under 'Month_0' for the cohort starting in December 2010 indicates that customers from this cohort collectively generated a revenue of 66,676 units of currency in the month of their first purchase.
  - Similarly, the value 25,436 under 'Month_1' for the same cohort indicates that in the subsequent month, these customers generated a revenue of 25,436 units of currency.

- **Interpretation:**
  - The table provides insights into how revenue generated by different cohorts evolves over time.
  - It's evident that cohorts generally exhibit a decreasing trend in revenue over the months after their initial purchase, which is a common pattern in many businesses.
  - Some cohorts, such as the December 2010 cohort, exhibit a relatively higher initial revenue, which gradually tapers off over time.
  - Negative values in certain cells (like -632 under 'Month_0' for the July 2011 cohort) indicate a decline in revenue during those months compared to the initial month.

The table illustrates changing revenue patterns for different cohorts over the months after their first purchase, providing insights into customer behavior and revenue generation trends.
