📊 In this project, I've built a series of dashboards that offer invaluable perspectives on finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive performance. The key takeaway? Data transparency leads to informed decisions, setting the stage for long-term success.

📂 Here's a quick look at the dashboards:
- 🏠 Home - Your hub for an overview of all the Pages.
- ℹ️ Info - All the essential information you need.
- 💰 Finance View - Dive into the P & L performance.
- 📊 Sales View - Get the breakdown on customer performance.
- 🎯 Marketing View - Explore product performance.
- 📦 Supply Chain View - Keep tabs on demand and supply.
- 📈 Executive View - The big picture of company performance.

📈 Some of the vital KPIs in the mix:
- ❇ Net Sales
- ❇ Gross Margin %
- ❇ Net Profit %
- ❇ Net Error
- ❇ Absolute Error
- ❇ Forecast Accuracy %

💡 What I've learned along the way:
- Data modeling techniques
- KPI indicators usage
- Creating calculated columns
- DAX language for measures
- Tolerance limit filters and Tooltips
- Dynamic page navigation with buttons
- Visuals with conditional formatting
- Data validation methods
- Publishing reports to Power BI services

🤓 I've also delved into the world of business with a solid grasp of terms like Gross Sale, Net Invoice Sales, COGS, Gross Margin, Net Profit, and many more.

🎯 What's next, you ask? I'm excited to leverage these skills and insights to deliver meaningful data-driven value to all stakeholders. Let's keep this data adventure rolling!
