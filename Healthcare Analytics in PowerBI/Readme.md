## Project Overview

HealthStat, a fictitious consulting company, hired us to analyze an anonymized dataset from hospitals in New York state. The goal is to uncover insights on potential hospital efficiency opportunities for patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery. We utilized Power BI to create an engaging dashboard to visualize and present our findings.

### Dataset Details

- **Data Source:** New York state-wide hospital discharge data for the year 2016
- **Patient Population:** Those with "Elective hip replacement surgery"

### Key Attributes of Interest

1. `length_of_stay`: Length of stay for patients.
2. `total_costs`: Total costs associated with each inpatient stay.

## Data Analysis

### Initial Exploration

- Number of Hospitals: 151
- Total Discharges: 26,286
- Average Length of Stay (LOS): 2.65 days

### Calculated DAX Measures

- Total Hospitals
- Total Discharges
- Total Surgeons
- Average Cost per Discharge
- Average Cost per Discharge (All)
- Average LOS Days
- Average LOS Days (All)
- % Variance in Average Cost per Discharge
- % Variance in Average LOS Days
- and more

## Insights Explored

1. **Identifying Outliers:** We determined which hospitals had the highest costs and LOS relative to the state average.
2. **Overall Outliers:** We identified hospitals that stood out as the biggest outliers in terms of cost and LOS.
3. **Impact of Surgical Program Size:** We investigated whether the size of the surgical program in a hospital affected LOS and cost.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** We delved into factors that influenced LOS and cost the most.

## Key Findings

- Average cost per discharge was $20,910.
- Top influencers increasing average LOS and cost included extreme illness severity, major mortality risk, hospitals in New York City, and patient disposition to skilled nursing homes.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard we created visually presents the key insights and metrics derived from the dataset. It allows stakeholders to interactively explore the data and gain a better understanding of hospital efficiency opportunities for elective hip replacement surgeries.

## Conclusion

In this case study, we successfully analyzed the New York state-wide hospital discharge data for elective hip replacement surgeries in 2016. Our Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights to HealthStat, enabling them to identify hospitals with potential efficiency improvements and make informed decisions.
