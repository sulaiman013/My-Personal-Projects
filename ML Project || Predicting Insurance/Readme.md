## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Premium Prediction

This lecture details the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed on a dataset for premium prediction.  We'll walk through each step, explaining the rationale and the code used.  The overall goal is to prepare the data for a machine learning model.

**1. Importing Libraries and Loading Data:**

The first step involves importing necessary libraries like Pandas and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  It's recommended to organize your project by creating a dedicated folder containing both the dataset file and the Jupyter Notebook.

**2. Standardizing Column Names:**

Consistent column names are crucial for readability and ease of use.  We'll convert all column names to Python's snake_case convention.

```python
import pandas as pd

# ... (Code to load the dataframe 'df')

df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(' ', '_').str.lower()
print(df.head())
```

This code snippet replaces spaces with underscores and converts all characters to lowercase, ensuring uniformity.

**3. Handling Missing Values (NA):**

Checking for and handling missing values is a critical step.

```python
print(df.isna().sum())  # Check for missing values in each column

df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop rows with any missing values

print(df.isna().sum())  # Verify that missing values are handled
```

We first assess the extent of missing data using `isna().sum()`.  Given the relatively small number of missing values compared to the dataset size, we opted to drop the rows containing them using `dropna(inplace=True)`.  For datasets with a significant number of missing values, imputation techniques (using mean, median, or mode) would be more appropriate.

**4. Handling Duplicate Rows:**

While our dataset didn't contain duplicates, it's good practice to include a check and removal step for future-proofing the code.

```python
print(df.duplicated().sum())  # Check for duplicate rows

df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)  # Drop duplicate rows (if any)

print(df.duplicated().sum()) # Verify
```

This code snippet checks for duplicates using `duplicated().sum()` and removes them using `drop_duplicates(inplace=True)`.

**5. Initial Data Exploration and Outlier Detection:**

We use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data and identify potential outliers.

```python
print(df.describe())  # Display summary statistics for numeric columns
```

The `describe()` function provides insights into the distribution of numeric columns, revealing potential issues like the unrealistic maximum age and negative values in the number of dependents.

**6. Addressing Specific Data Errors:**

We identified negative values in the 'number_of_dependents' column. After investigation and discussion with the data source, we decided to convert these to positive values, assuming a data entry error.

```python
print(df[df['number_of_dependents'] < 0].shape)  # Number of rows with negative dependents
print(df['number_of_dependents'].unique())  # Unique values in the column

df['number_of_dependents'] = abs(df['number_of_dependents'])  # Convert to positive values

print(df['number_of_dependents'].describe()) # Verify
```

**7. Visualizing Outliers with Box Plots:**

Box plots are helpful for visualizing outliers based on the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

numeric_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns

for col in numeric_cols:
    sns.boxplot(x=df[col])
    plt.title(f"Box plot of {col}")
    plt.show()
```

This code iterates through numeric columns and generates a box plot for each, highlighting potential outliers.

**8. Treating Outliers in 'age' Column:**

For the 'age' column, a simple threshold of 100 was used to remove unrealistic values.

```python
df1 = df[df['age'] <= 100].copy() # Create a new dataframe with filtered age
print(df1.describe()) # Verify
```

**9. Treating Outliers in 'income' Column:**

The 'income' column was analyzed using a histogram and the IQR method.  However, the IQR upper bound was deemed too restrictive based on domain knowledge.  Instead, the 99.9th percentile was used as a threshold.

```python
def get_iqr_bounds(column):
    q1 = column.quantile(0.25)
    q3 = column.quantile(0.75)
    iqr = q3 - q1
    lower_bound = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
    upper_bound = q3 + 1.5 * iqr
    return lower_bound, upper_bound

# Example of IQR calculation (though not used in the final approach)
lower_bound, upper_bound = get_iqr_bounds(df1['income_lacks'])
print(f"Lower Bound: {lower_bound}, Upper Bound: {upper_bound}")

threshold = df1['income_lacks'].quantile(0.999) # Using 99.9th percentile
print(f"Threshold: {threshold}")

df2 = df1[df1['income_lacks'] <= threshold].copy() # Create new dataframe with filtered income
print(df2.describe())  # Verify changes
```

This concludes the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.  The resulting DataFrame `df2` is now ready for further analysis and model building.  Remember, data cleaning is an iterative process and often requires domain expertise and careful consideration of the data's context.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Continued: Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

This lecture builds upon the previous data cleaning steps and delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA), specifically univariate and bivariate analysis.  We'll examine the distribution of numeric variables, explore relationships between variables, and prepare the data for feature engineering.

**1. Distribution of Numeric Columns (Univariate Analysis):**

Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of numeric data. This helps understand the data's characteristics, such as skewness and central tendency.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# ... (Code to load the cleaned dataframe 'df2')

for col in numeric_cols:
    plt.figure()  # Create a new figure for each plot
    sns.histplot(df2[col])
    plt.title(f"Distribution of {col}")
    plt.show()

```

This code iterates through the numeric columns and generates a histogram for each.  We've added `plt.figure()` to ensure each histogram is displayed separately, improving clarity.

**2. Improving Visualization Layout:**

To enhance readability, especially with multiple plots, we can arrange them in a grid-like structure.  While tools like ChatGPT can assist with generating the code for this, it's crucial to understand the code and not rely solely on copy-pasting.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8)) # 2 rows, 2 columns of plots

sns.histplot(df2['age'], ax=axes[0, 0])
axes[0, 0].set_title('Distribution of Age')

# ... (Similar code for other numeric columns - income_lacks, number_of_dependents, annual_premium_amount)

plt.tight_layout() # Adjusts subplot params so that subplots are nicely fit in the figure
plt.show()

```

This revised code uses `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` to create a grid of subplots and assigns each histogram to a specific location within the grid.

**3. Bivariate Analysis with Scatter Plots:**

Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables.

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='annual_premium_amount', data=df2)
plt.title("Scatter Plot of Age vs. Annual Premium Amount")
plt.show()
```

This code creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between 'age' and 'annual_premium_amount'.  The observed positive correlation confirms the intuitive understanding that premium amounts tend to increase with age.

**4. Bivariate Analysis for Multiple Variables:**

We can extend this to visualize relationships between other numeric independent variables and the target variable ('annual_premium_amount').

```python
independent_numeric_cols = ['age', 'number_of_dependents', 'income_lacks']

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(independent_numeric_cols), figsize=(15, 5))

for i, col in enumerate(independent_numeric_cols):
    sns.scatterplot(x=col, y='annual_premium_amount', data=df2, ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f"Scatter Plot of {col} vs. Annual Premium Amount")


plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code generates multiple scatter plots, arranged horizontally, to visualize the relationship between each independent numeric variable and the target variable.

**5. Analyzing Categorical Columns:**

We then shift our focus to categorical columns, exploring their unique values and distributions.

```python
categorical_cols = ['gender', 'region', 'marital_status', 'smoking_status', 'income_level', 'medical_history', 'insurance_plan']

for col in categorical_cols:
    print(f"Unique values in {col}: {df2[col].unique()}")
```

This code prints the unique values for each categorical column, revealing inconsistencies in the 'smoking_status' column.

**6. Handling Inconsistent Categorical Values:**

We address the inconsistencies in 'smoking_status' by replacing redundant categories with a standardized value ('no_smoking').

```python
df2['smoking_status'].replace({'smoking_zero': 'no_smoking', 'does_not_smoke': 'no_smoking', 'not_smoking': 'no_smoking'}, inplace=True)
print(f"Unique values in smoking_status after cleaning: {df2['smoking_status'].unique()}")
```

This code replaces variations of "no smoking" with a single consistent value.

**7. Univariate Analysis of Categorical Columns:**

We then analyze the frequency distribution of categorical variables using `value_counts()` and visualize them using bar plots.

```python
percentage_count = df2['gender'].value_counts(normalize=True)
sns.barplot(x=percentage_count.index, y=percentage_count.values)
plt.title("Gender Distribution")
plt.ylabel("Percentage")
plt.show()


# ... (Similar code for other categorical columns using subplots for better layout)
```

This code calculates and visualizes the distribution of the 'gender' column.  Similar code can be applied to other categorical columns using subplots for a more organized display.

**8. Bivariate Analysis of Categorical Columns:**

We use `pd.crosstab` to analyze the relationship between two categorical variables.  This generates a contingency table showing the frequency of each combination of categories.

```python
cross_tab = pd.crosstab(df2['income_level'], df2['insurance_plan'])
print(cross_tab)


cross_tab.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)
plt.title("Income Level vs. Insurance Plan")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()


sns.heatmap(cross_tab, annot=True, fmt="d")
plt.title("Income Level vs. Insurance Plan (Heatmap)")
plt.show()

```

This code demonstrates how to generate a cross-tabulation and visualize it using both stacked bar plots and heatmaps.  The `fmt="d"` argument ensures integer values are displayed in the heatmap.

This concludes the EDA portion, providing a comprehensive understanding of both numeric and categorical variables and their relationships. The next step is feature engineering, which will prepare the data for machine learning model training.

## Feature Engineering for Insurance Premium Prediction

This lecture details the feature engineering process for a machine learning model predicting insurance premiums. We'll transform raw data into suitable numerical representations for the model, addressing categorical and numerical features, handling missing values, and performing feature selection.

### 1. Handling Complex Categorical Features

The `medical_history` column contains a list of diseases for each individual. Since machine learning models require numerical input, we convert this list into a numerical "health risk score." Each disease is assigned a specific risk score based on domain expertise (e.g., diabetes = 6, heart disease = 8, no disease = 0). The total risk score for an individual is the sum of the risk scores of all their diseases.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample medical_history data
medical_history = ["diabetes, high blood pressure", "heart disease", "none", "diabetes"]

# Dictionary mapping diseases to risk scores
scores = {
    "diabetes": 6,
    "high blood pressure": 2,
    "heart disease": 8,
    "none": 0
}

# Calculating risk scores
risk_scores = []
for history in medical_history:
    diseases = [d.strip().lower() for d in history.split(',')]
    score = sum(scores.get(disease, 0) for disease in diseases)  # Handles unknown diseases
    risk_scores.append(score)

print(risk_scores)  # Output: [8, 8, 0, 6]
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Splitting Diseases:** The `medical_history` string is split into individual diseases using a comma delimiter and converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.
2. **Mapping Scores:** Each disease is mapped to its corresponding risk score using the `scores` dictionary. If a disease isn't found in the dictionary, a default score of 0 is assigned.
3. **Summing Scores:** The scores for all diseases an individual has are summed to obtain the total risk score.

**Normalization:**
After calculating the total risk score, we normalize it to a 0-1 range using Min-Max scaling. This ensures that features with different scales do not disproportionately influence the model.

```python
# Example normalization
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
normalized_risk_scores = scaler.fit_transform(pd.DataFrame(risk_scores))

print(normalized_risk_scores)  # Outputs normalized scores between 0 and 1
```

### 2. Encoding Ordinal Categorical Features

Features like `insurance_plan` (bronze, silver, gold) represent ordinal categories. We use label encoding to assign numerical values while preserving the order (e.g., bronze = 1, silver = 2, gold = 3). This approach captures the inherent ranking within the categories.

```python
# Sample insurance_plan data
insurance_plans = ["bronze", "silver", "gold", "bronze"]

# Mapping ordinal categories
plan_mapping = {"bronze": 1, "silver": 2, "gold": 3}
encoded_plans = [plan_mapping[plan] for plan in insurance_plans]

print(encoded_plans)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1]
```

### 3. Encoding Nominal Categorical Features

Nominal categorical features like `gender` and `region` have no inherent order. We use one-hot encoding to create dummy variables for each category. This avoids introducing artificial ordinal relationships between the categories. The `drop_first` parameter in `pd.get_dummies` is used to prevent multicollinearity by dropping one dummy variable from each category.

```python
# Sample nominal data
data = {
    'gender': ['male', 'female', 'female', 'male'],
    'region': ['southwest', 'southeast', 'northwest', 'southeast']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# One-hot encoding
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['gender', 'region'], drop_first=True)

print(df_encoded)
```

**Output:**
```
   gender_male  region_northwest  region_southeast  region_southwest
0            1                 0                  0                  1
1            0                 0                  1                  0
2            0                 1                  0                  0
3            1                 0                  1                  0
```

### 4. Dropping Redundant Features

After calculating the `normalized_risk_score`, the original `medical_history` column and the intermediate columns used for calculating the score become redundant and are dropped to streamline the dataset.

```python
# Dropping redundant columns
df_final = df_encoded.drop(['medical_history', 'intermediate_column_1', 'intermediate_column_2'], axis=1)
```

*Ensure you replace `'intermediate_column_1'` and `'intermediate_column_2'` with actual column names used in your dataset.*

### 5. Correlation Analysis and Feature Selection

We use a correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between features. High correlations may indicate redundancy. However, a more robust approach is to calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each feature. VIF quantifies the multicollinearity between a feature and all other features. Features with a VIF greater than 10 are typically considered highly correlated and are candidates for removal. The process is iterative, removing one feature at a time and recalculating VIF until all remaining features have acceptable VIF values.

**Correlation Matrix Visualization:**

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df_final.corr()

# Plot heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```

**Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Calculation:**

```python
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

# Preparing DataFrame for VIF calculation
X = df_final.drop('annual_premium_amount', axis=1)
y = df_final['annual_premium_amount']

# Scaling features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=X.columns)

# Function to calculate VIF
def calculate_vif(df):
    vif = pd.DataFrame()
    vif["Feature"] = df.columns
    vif["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(df.values, i) for i in range(df.shape[1])]
    return vif

vif_df = calculate_vif(X_scaled)
print(vif_df)
```

**Removing Features with High VIF:**

Iteratively remove features with the highest VIF and recalculate until all VIF values are below 10.

```python
# Example: Dropping 'income_level' due to high VIF
X_reduced = X_scaled.drop('income_level', axis=1)
vif_reduced = calculate_vif(X_reduced)
print(vif_reduced)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Income Level vs. Income in Lacks:** If `income_level` is a binned version of `income_lacks`, they are highly correlated. Dropping one prevents redundancy.
- **Iterative Process:** Always drop the feature with the highest VIF first to effectively reduce multicollinearity.


### Summary

This comprehensive feature engineering process prepares the data for model training by:

- **Transforming Categorical Features:** Converting complex and categorical data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.
- **Handling Redundancies:** Dropping irrelevant or redundant features to streamline the dataset.
- **Addressing Multicollinearity:** Using correlation analysis and VIF to identify and remove highly correlated features, ensuring model stability.
- **Scaling Features:** Normalizing numerical features to ensure balanced influence across all predictors.

By meticulously engineering features, we enhance the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable insurance premium predictions.



## Lecture Article: Predicting Insurance Premiums with Machine Learning

This lecture details the process of building a machine learning model to predict insurance premiums. We will explore various models, evaluate their performance, and discuss techniques for model interpretation.

### 1. Data Preparation and Splitting

We begin by preparing our data.  Assuming we have a dataset with features relevant to insurance premiums (e.g., age, number of dependents, income, risk score, insurance plan type, etc.), and a target variable representing the premium amount, we first perform a train-test split.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming 'x_reduced' contains the features and 'Y' contains the target variable
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_reduced, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=10)

print(x_train.shape)
print(x_test.shape)
```

This code splits the data into training and testing sets (70% train, 30% test) using a `random_state` for reproducibility.  Printing the shapes confirms the size of each set (e.g., 34,000 training samples, 14,000 test samples).

### 2. Linear Regression

Our first model is linear regression.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model_linear = LinearRegression()
model_linear.fit(x_train, y_train)

train_score = model_linear.score(x_train, y_train)
test_score = model_linear.score(x_test, y_test)

print("Train Score:", train_score)
print("Test Score:", test_score)
```

We fit the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using the R-squared score on both training and testing sets.  Comparing these scores helps identify potential overfitting (high train score, low test score).  In this example, both scores are around 0.92, indicating no significant overfitting.

#### 2.1 Interpreting Linear Regression Coefficients

Linear regression offers excellent interpretability. The coefficients represent the relationship between each feature and the target variable.

```python
print("Coefficients:", model_linear.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model_linear.intercept_)

print(x_train.columns) # Displaying the order of features

# Creating a dataframe for visualization
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Coefficient': model_linear.coef_}, index=x_train.columns)
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by='Coefficient')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importance.index, feature_importance['Coefficient'])
plt.xlabel("Coefficient Value")
plt.title("Feature Importance in Linear Regression")
plt.show()
```

This code prints the coefficients and intercept.  Visualizing the coefficients as a horizontal bar chart helps understand each feature's contribution to the prediction.  A larger magnitude coefficient indicates a stronger influence.  The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative).

### 3. Exploring Other Models

While linear regression performed well (R-squared of 0.92), we explore other models to potentially improve performance. We briefly experimented with Ridge Regression, but it didn't yield significant improvements.

### 4. XGBoost

Next, we try XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

```python
import xgboost as xgb

model_xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor()
model_xgb.fit(x_train, y_train)

train_score_xgb = model_xgb.score(x_train, y_train)
test_score_xgb = model_xgb.score(x_test, y_test)

print("Train Score (XGBoost):", train_score_xgb)
print("Test Score (XGBoost):", test_score_xgb)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse_xgb = mean_squared_error(y_test, model_xgb.predict(x_test), squared=False)
print("RMSE (XGBoost):", rmse_xgb)
```

XGBoost achieves a significantly higher R-squared score (around 0.98) and a lower RMSE compared to linear regression.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

To further optimize XGBoost, we use `RandomizedSearchCV`.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
import numpy as np

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [20, 14, 53],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.01, 0.001],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7]
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model_xgb, param_distributions=param_grid, n_iter=10, cv=3, scoring='r2')
random_search.fit(x_train, y_train)

best_model = random_search.best_estimator_

feature_importance_xgb = best_model.feature_importances_

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(x_train.columns, feature_importance_xgb)
plt.xlabel("Feature Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importance in XGBoost")
plt.show()

```

This code searches for optimal hyperparameters within the defined `param_grid`.  While the improvement in R-squared was minimal in this case, hyperparameter tuning is crucial for maximizing model performance.

### 6. Feature Importance in XGBoost

We can also extract feature importance from the tuned XGBoost model. However, the interpretation is not as straightforward as in linear regression.  While we can identify important features, we cannot directly quantify their impact on the prediction as we could with linear regression coefficients.

### 7. Conclusion

This lecture demonstrated the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for insurance premium prediction.  While XGBoost achieved the highest performance, the interpretability of linear regression remains valuable. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing performance and explainability.

## Lecture Article: Error Analysis and Handling Extreme Prediction Errors

This lecture focuses on analyzing prediction errors, particularly extreme errors, and identifying their potential root causes within specific feature groups.

### 1. Calculating Prediction Errors

After training our model (in the previous lecture, we identified XGBoost as the best performing model), we must analyze its predictions on the test set.

```python
y_predicted = best_model.predict(x_test) # 'best_model' from the previous lecture (tuned XGBoost model)

residuals = y_predicted - y_test
residuals_percentage = (residuals / y_test) * 100

results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual': y_test,
    'Predicted': y_predicted,
    'Residuals': residuals,
    'Residuals Percentage': residuals_percentage
})

print(results_df.head())
```

This code calculates the raw difference (`residuals`) and percentage difference (`residuals_percentage`) between predicted and actual premiums. Storing these values in a DataFrame facilitates further analysis.

### 2. Visualizing Error Distribution

Visualizing the distribution of percentage errors helps understand the overall error profile.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(results_df['Residuals Percentage'], kde=True)
plt.xlabel("Residuals Percentage")
plt.title("Distribution of Residuals Percentage")
plt.show()
```

The histogram reveals the frequency of different error magnitudes.  A concentration around zero is desirable, indicating accurate predictions.  However, long tails or significant frequencies far from zero suggest potential issues.

### 3. Identifying Extreme Errors

We define a threshold for extreme errors (e.g., 10%) and identify records exceeding this threshold.

```python
threshold = 10
extreme_results_df = results_df[np.abs(results_df['Residuals Percentage']) > threshold]

percentage_extreme_error = (len(extreme_results_df) / len(results_df)) * 100
print("Percentage of Extreme Errors:", percentage_extreme_error)

# Analyzing errors above 50%
extreme_50_df = results_df[np.abs(results_df['Residuals Percentage']) > 50]
print("Number of records with >50% error:", len(extreme_50_df))


# Sorting to find the most severe errors
results_df_sorted = results_df.sort_values(by='Residuals Percentage', ascending=False)
print(results_df_sorted.head())
```

This code filters the `results_df` to isolate extreme errors.  Calculating the percentage of extreme errors provides a measure of the model's reliability.  Further analysis, like sorting by error magnitude, helps identify the most problematic predictions.

### 4. Investigating the Root Cause of Extreme Errors

To understand why extreme errors occur, we examine the features of the records with these errors.

```python
extreme_errors_df = x_test.loc[extreme_results_df.index] # Selecting corresponding features from x_test
```

This code selects the features from `x_test` corresponding to the extreme errors.  This allows us to investigate if certain feature values are associated with higher error rates.

### 5. Comparing Distributions

We compare the feature distributions in the extreme error set with the overall test set.

```python
for feature in x_test.columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(x_test[feature], kde=True, label='Overall', color='blue', alpha=0.5)
    sns.histplot(extreme_errors_df[feature], kde=True, label='Extreme Errors', color='red', alpha=0.5)
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.title(f"Distribution of {feature} (Overall vs. Extreme Errors)")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

This code iterates through each feature, plotting its distribution in both the entire test set and the extreme error subset.  Differences in the shapes of these distributions can reveal potential problem areas. For example, if a particular age group shows a much higher frequency in the extreme error distribution than in the overall distribution, it suggests that the model struggles with that age group.

### 6.  Reverse Scaling and Further Analysis

Since the features were scaled during preprocessing, we reverse the scaling to interpret the results in the original feature space.

```python
# Adding a dummy income level column since it was dropped previously
extreme_errors_df['income_level'] = -1 # Placeholder value

df_reversed = pd.DataFrame(scaler.inverse_transform(extreme_errors_df[columns_to_scale]), columns=columns_to_scale, index=extreme_errors_df.index)

sns.histplot(df_reversed['age'])
plt.xlabel("Age (Original Scale)")
plt.title("Distribution of Age in Extreme Errors (Original Scale)")
plt.show()

print(df_reversed['age'].describe())
print(df_reversed['age'].quantile(0.97))
```

This code reverses the scaling applied during preprocessing.  The `columns_to_scale` and `scaler` objects should be the same as used in the initial data preparation steps.  This allows us to analyze the age distribution in its original scale and identify specific age ranges with high error rates.  In this example, we found that 97% of the extreme errors occur for individuals aged 25 or younger, indicating a significant issue with predictions for this demographic.


This detailed error analysis provides valuable insights into model behavior and guides further model improvement, feature engineering, or data collection efforts.  Addressing these identified issues is crucial for deploying a reliable and trustworthy model in a real-world setting.

## Lecture Article: Model Segmentation for Improved Accuracy

This lecture introduces the concept of model segmentation, a technique for improving model performance by training separate models for different segments of the data.  We'll demonstrate this approach using the insurance premium prediction problem, focusing on the age-related error patterns identified in the previous lecture.

### 1. The Motivation for Model Segmentation

Real-world machine learning projects often require more nuanced approaches than training a single model on the entire dataset.  Model segmentation addresses this by training specialized models for specific data segments, improving overall performance and handling edge cases more effectively.

### 2. Segmenting the Data

Our error analysis revealed significant issues with predictions for younger individuals (age ≤ 25).  Therefore, we segment our data based on this age threshold.

```python
df_rest = df[df['age'] > 25]
df_young = df[df['age'] <= 25]

print("Shape of Rest of Data:", df_rest.shape)
print("Shape of Young Data:", df_young.shape)

df_young.to_excel("premiums_young.xlsx", index=False)
df_rest.to_excel("premiums_rest.xlsx", index=False)

```

This code creates two new DataFrames: `df_rest` for individuals older than 25 and `df_young` for those 25 or younger.  We then export these DataFrames to separate Excel files for subsequent model training.

### 3. Training a Model for the "Rest" Segment

We train a model specifically for the `df_rest` dataset. The process is similar to the previous lectures, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.  We simply replace the original data with `premiums_rest.xlsx`.

**(The code for this section would be similar to the model training code from previous lectures, with the only change being the data loading part.)**

After training and evaluating several models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.), we found that XGBoost achieved the best performance on this segment, reaching an R-squared score of 99%.  Crucially, the error analysis for this segment shows a significantly reduced percentage of extreme errors (around 0.3%).

### 4. Training a Model for the "Young" Segment

We repeat the process for the `df_young` dataset, using `premiums_young.xlsx`.

**(Again, the code would be similar, only changing the data loading part.)**

In this case, even after trying different models and hyperparameter tuning, the best performance (around 60% R-squared) was achieved by linear regression.  The error analysis still reveals a high percentage of extreme errors (around 73%), indicating that this segment requires further investigation.


### 5. Analyzing Errors in the "Young" Segment

We perform a similar error analysis as before, comparing feature distributions in the extreme error subset with the overall `df_young` dataset.


```python
# Code for error analysis and distribution comparison, as in the previous lecture,
# but using the 'df_young' dataset and the model trained on this segment.
```

The analysis reveals that the errors are distributed across all feature values within the younger age group, suggesting that the existing features are insufficient to explain the variance in premiums for this segment.

### 6. Next Steps for the "Young" Segment

To improve the model's performance on the younger segment, we have two primary options:

* **Feature Engineering:** Explore new features or transformations of existing features that might better capture the underlying relationships for this demographic.  This might involve creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or domain-specific features.

* **Collect More Data:**  If feature engineering is insufficient, collecting more data, especially for the younger age group, could provide the model with more information to learn from and improve its predictive accuracy.  This could involve gathering more detailed information about lifestyle, health conditions, or other relevant factors.


By segmenting the data and training specialized models, we significantly improved performance for the "rest" segment and isolated the challenges within the "young" segment.  This targeted approach allows us to focus our efforts on improving the model for the specific demographic where it struggles, ultimately leading to a more robust and accurate overall prediction system.

## Lecture Article: Incorporating Genetic Risk and Finalizing Model Training

This lecture details incorporating a new feature, "genetic risk," into our model for the young population segment and finalizing the models for both young and rest segments for deployment.

### 1. Integrating Genetic Risk Data

We received a new dataset containing genetic risk information for the young population. We'll incorporate this feature into our existing model for this segment.

```python
# Create a copy of the existing "young" notebook and load the new data
# ... (Code for creating a copy of the notebook is platform-specific and not included here)

df_young_gr = pd.read_excel("Premiums_Young_with_GR.xlsx")
```

This code loads the new dataset, which includes the 'genetic_risk' column.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Genetic Risk

We perform EDA on the new feature to understand its distribution and relationship with the target variable.

```python
# Box plot for outlier detection
sns.boxplot(x=df_young_gr['genetic_risk'])
plt.show()

# Distribution plot
sns.histplot(df_young_gr['genetic_risk'], kde=True)
plt.show()

# Scatter plot against premium amount
plt.scatter(df_young_gr['genetic_risk'], df_young_gr['premium_amount'])
plt.xlabel("Genetic Risk")
plt.ylabel("Premium Amount")
plt.show()

# Update visualizations for five numeric features (including genetic risk)
# ... (Code for updating visualizations, potentially using ChatGPT as demonstrated in the original text)
```

These visualizations help identify potential outliers, understand the distribution of genetic risk, and confirm its expected positive correlation with premium amounts.

### 3. Model Training with Genetic Risk

We incorporate the `genetic_risk` feature into our model training pipeline.

```python
# Include 'genetic_risk' in correlation analysis
corr_matrix = df_young_gr.corr()
print(corr_matrix)

# Include 'genetic_risk' in feature scaling
columns_to_scale.append('genetic_risk') # Assuming 'columns_to_scale' is defined earlier

# ... (Rest of the preprocessing and model training code, similar to previous lectures)
```

Including `genetic_risk` in the preprocessing and model training steps ensures that the model leverages this new information.  Remarkably, adding this single feature significantly improved the model's performance for the young segment, increasing the R-squared score from 60% to 98%.


### 4. Error Analysis with Genetic Risk

We repeat the error analysis process to assess the impact of the new feature on prediction errors.

```python
# ... (Error analysis code, as in the previous lecture)
```

The error analysis reveals a dramatic reduction in extreme errors for the young segment, from 73% down to 2%. This confirms the value of the `genetic_risk` feature.

### 5.  Handling the "Rest" Segment with Genetic Risk

While we currently lack genetic risk data for the "rest" segment, we prepare our model for future inclusion of this feature.  We add a dummy `genetic_risk` column (with a placeholder value like 0 or -1) to the "rest" dataset and include it in the preprocessing and model training pipeline.  This ensures consistency between the models and simplifies future integration of genetic risk data for this segment.

```python
df_rest['genetic_risk'] = -1 # Adding a dummy column

# Include 'genetic_risk' in feature scaling for the "rest" model as well
# ... (Rest of the preprocessing and model training code for the "rest" segment)

```

### 6. Exporting the Final Models and Scaler

We export the trained models and the scaler object for both segments for later use in deployment.

```python
import joblib
import os

# Create an 'artifacts' directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists("artifacts"):
    os.makedirs("artifacts")


# Export the "young" model and scaler
joblib.dump(best_model_young, "artifacts/model_young.joblib") # 'best_model_young' is the trained model for the young segment
scaler_with_columns = {'scaler': scaler, 'columns': columns_to_scale}
joblib.dump(scaler_with_columns, "artifacts/scaler.joblib")  # Using the same scaler for both models


# Export the "rest" model
joblib.dump(best_model_rest, "artifacts/model_rest.joblib") # 'best_model_rest' is the trained model for the rest segment

```

This code saves the trained models and the scaler object to the `artifacts` directory.  We use the same scaler object for both models to maintain consistency.

### 7. Conclusion

By incorporating genetic risk and performing model segmentation, we achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy, especially for the young population.  Exporting the final models and scaler prepares us for the next stage: building a user interface and deploying the models using Streamlit.
