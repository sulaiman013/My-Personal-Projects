## Lecture Article: Predicting Insurance Premiums with Machine Learning

This lecture details the process of building a machine learning model to predict insurance premiums. We will explore various models, evaluate their performance, and discuss techniques for model interpretation.

### 1. Data Preparation and Splitting

We begin by preparing our data.  Assuming we have a dataset with features relevant to insurance premiums (e.g., age, number of dependents, income, risk score, insurance plan type, etc.), and a target variable representing the premium amount, we first perform a train-test split.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming 'x_reduced' contains the features and 'Y' contains the target variable
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_reduced, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=10)

print(x_train.shape)
print(x_test.shape)
```

This code splits the data into training and testing sets (70% train, 30% test) using a `random_state` for reproducibility.  Printing the shapes confirms the size of each set (e.g., 34,000 training samples, 14,000 test samples).

### 2. Linear Regression

Our first model is linear regression.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model_linear = LinearRegression()
model_linear.fit(x_train, y_train)

train_score = model_linear.score(x_train, y_train)
test_score = model_linear.score(x_test, y_test)

print("Train Score:", train_score)
print("Test Score:", test_score)
```

We fit the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using the R-squared score on both training and testing sets.  Comparing these scores helps identify potential overfitting (high train score, low test score).  In this example, both scores are around 0.92, indicating no significant overfitting.

#### 2.1 Interpreting Linear Regression Coefficients

Linear regression offers excellent interpretability. The coefficients represent the relationship between each feature and the target variable.

```python
print("Coefficients:", model_linear.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model_linear.intercept_)

print(x_train.columns) # Displaying the order of features

# Creating a dataframe for visualization
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Coefficient': model_linear.coef_}, index=x_train.columns)
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by='Coefficient')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importance.index, feature_importance['Coefficient'])
plt.xlabel("Coefficient Value")
plt.title("Feature Importance in Linear Regression")
plt.show()
```

This code prints the coefficients and intercept.  Visualizing the coefficients as a horizontal bar chart helps understand each feature's contribution to the prediction.  A larger magnitude coefficient indicates a stronger influence.  The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative).

### 3. Exploring Other Models

While linear regression performed well (R-squared of 0.92), we explore other models to potentially improve performance. We briefly experimented with Ridge Regression, but it didn't yield significant improvements.

### 4. XGBoost

Next, we try XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

```python
import xgboost as xgb

model_xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor()
model_xgb.fit(x_train, y_train)

train_score_xgb = model_xgb.score(x_train, y_train)
test_score_xgb = model_xgb.score(x_test, y_test)

print("Train Score (XGBoost):", train_score_xgb)
print("Test Score (XGBoost):", test_score_xgb)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse_xgb = mean_squared_error(y_test, model_xgb.predict(x_test), squared=False)
print("RMSE (XGBoost):", rmse_xgb)
```

XGBoost achieves a significantly higher R-squared score (around 0.98) and a lower RMSE compared to linear regression.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

To further optimize XGBoost, we use `RandomizedSearchCV`.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
import numpy as np

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [20, 14, 53],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.01, 0.001],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7]
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model_xgb, param_distributions=param_grid, n_iter=10, cv=3, scoring='r2')
random_search.fit(x_train, y_train)

best_model = random_search.best_estimator_

feature_importance_xgb = best_model.feature_importances_

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(x_train.columns, feature_importance_xgb)
plt.xlabel("Feature Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importance in XGBoost")
plt.show()

```

This code searches for optimal hyperparameters within the defined `param_grid`.  While the improvement in R-squared was minimal in this case, hyperparameter tuning is crucial for maximizing model performance.

### 6. Feature Importance in XGBoost

We can also extract feature importance from the tuned XGBoost model. However, the interpretation is not as straightforward as in linear regression.  While we can identify important features, we cannot directly quantify their impact on the prediction as we could with linear regression coefficients.

### 7. Conclusion

This lecture demonstrated the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for insurance premium prediction.  While XGBoost achieved the highest performance, the interpretability of linear regression remains valuable. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing performance and explainability.

## Lecture Article: Error Analysis and Handling Extreme Prediction Errors

This lecture focuses on analyzing prediction errors, particularly extreme errors, and identifying their potential root causes within specific feature groups.

### 1. Calculating Prediction Errors

After training our model (in the previous lecture, we identified XGBoost as the best performing model), we must analyze its predictions on the test set.

```python
y_predicted = best_model.predict(x_test) # 'best_model' from the previous lecture (tuned XGBoost model)

residuals = y_predicted - y_test
residuals_percentage = (residuals / y_test) * 100

results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual': y_test,
    'Predicted': y_predicted,
    'Residuals': residuals,
    'Residuals Percentage': residuals_percentage
})

print(results_df.head())
```

This code calculates the raw difference (`residuals`) and percentage difference (`residuals_percentage`) between predicted and actual premiums. Storing these values in a DataFrame facilitates further analysis.

### 2. Visualizing Error Distribution

Visualizing the distribution of percentage errors helps understand the overall error profile.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(results_df['Residuals Percentage'], kde=True)
plt.xlabel("Residuals Percentage")
plt.title("Distribution of Residuals Percentage")
plt.show()
```

The histogram reveals the frequency of different error magnitudes.  A concentration around zero is desirable, indicating accurate predictions.  However, long tails or significant frequencies far from zero suggest potential issues.

### 3. Identifying Extreme Errors

We define a threshold for extreme errors (e.g., 10%) and identify records exceeding this threshold.

```python
threshold = 10
extreme_results_df = results_df[np.abs(results_df['Residuals Percentage']) > threshold]

percentage_extreme_error = (len(extreme_results_df) / len(results_df)) * 100
print("Percentage of Extreme Errors:", percentage_extreme_error)

# Analyzing errors above 50%
extreme_50_df = results_df[np.abs(results_df['Residuals Percentage']) > 50]
print("Number of records with >50% error:", len(extreme_50_df))


# Sorting to find the most severe errors
results_df_sorted = results_df.sort_values(by='Residuals Percentage', ascending=False)
print(results_df_sorted.head())
```

This code filters the `results_df` to isolate extreme errors.  Calculating the percentage of extreme errors provides a measure of the model's reliability.  Further analysis, like sorting by error magnitude, helps identify the most problematic predictions.

### 4. Investigating the Root Cause of Extreme Errors

To understand why extreme errors occur, we examine the features of the records with these errors.

```python
extreme_errors_df = x_test.loc[extreme_results_df.index] # Selecting corresponding features from x_test
```

This code selects the features from `x_test` corresponding to the extreme errors.  This allows us to investigate if certain feature values are associated with higher error rates.

### 5. Comparing Distributions

We compare the feature distributions in the extreme error set with the overall test set.

```python
for feature in x_test.columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(x_test[feature], kde=True, label='Overall', color='blue', alpha=0.5)
    sns.histplot(extreme_errors_df[feature], kde=True, label='Extreme Errors', color='red', alpha=0.5)
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.title(f"Distribution of {feature} (Overall vs. Extreme Errors)")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

This code iterates through each feature, plotting its distribution in both the entire test set and the extreme error subset.  Differences in the shapes of these distributions can reveal potential problem areas. For example, if a particular age group shows a much higher frequency in the extreme error distribution than in the overall distribution, it suggests that the model struggles with that age group.

### 6.  Reverse Scaling and Further Analysis

Since the features were scaled during preprocessing, we reverse the scaling to interpret the results in the original feature space.

```python
# Adding a dummy income level column since it was dropped previously
extreme_errors_df['income_level'] = -1 # Placeholder value

df_reversed = pd.DataFrame(scaler.inverse_transform(extreme_errors_df[columns_to_scale]), columns=columns_to_scale, index=extreme_errors_df.index)

sns.histplot(df_reversed['age'])
plt.xlabel("Age (Original Scale)")
plt.title("Distribution of Age in Extreme Errors (Original Scale)")
plt.show()

print(df_reversed['age'].describe())
print(df_reversed['age'].quantile(0.97))
```

This code reverses the scaling applied during preprocessing.  The `columns_to_scale` and `scaler` objects should be the same as used in the initial data preparation steps.  This allows us to analyze the age distribution in its original scale and identify specific age ranges with high error rates.  In this example, we found that 97% of the extreme errors occur for individuals aged 25 or younger, indicating a significant issue with predictions for this demographic.


This detailed error analysis provides valuable insights into model behavior and guides further model improvement, feature engineering, or data collection efforts.  Addressing these identified issues is crucial for deploying a reliable and trustworthy model in a real-world setting.

## Lecture Article: Model Segmentation for Improved Accuracy

This lecture introduces the concept of model segmentation, a technique for improving model performance by training separate models for different segments of the data.  We'll demonstrate this approach using the insurance premium prediction problem, focusing on the age-related error patterns identified in the previous lecture.

### 1. The Motivation for Model Segmentation

Real-world machine learning projects often require more nuanced approaches than training a single model on the entire dataset.  Model segmentation addresses this by training specialized models for specific data segments, improving overall performance and handling edge cases more effectively.

### 2. Segmenting the Data

Our error analysis revealed significant issues with predictions for younger individuals (age ≤ 25).  Therefore, we segment our data based on this age threshold.

```python
df_rest = df[df['age'] > 25]
df_young = df[df['age'] <= 25]

print("Shape of Rest of Data:", df_rest.shape)
print("Shape of Young Data:", df_young.shape)

df_young.to_excel("premiums_young.xlsx", index=False)
df_rest.to_excel("premiums_rest.xlsx", index=False)

```

This code creates two new DataFrames: `df_rest` for individuals older than 25 and `df_young` for those 25 or younger.  We then export these DataFrames to separate Excel files for subsequent model training.

### 3. Training a Model for the "Rest" Segment

We train a model specifically for the `df_rest` dataset. The process is similar to the previous lectures, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.  We simply replace the original data with `premiums_rest.xlsx`.

**(The code for this section would be similar to the model training code from previous lectures, with the only change being the data loading part.)**

After training and evaluating several models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.), we found that XGBoost achieved the best performance on this segment, reaching an R-squared score of 99%.  Crucially, the error analysis for this segment shows a significantly reduced percentage of extreme errors (around 0.3%).

### 4. Training a Model for the "Young" Segment

We repeat the process for the `df_young` dataset, using `premiums_young.xlsx`.

**(Again, the code would be similar, only changing the data loading part.)**

In this case, even after trying different models and hyperparameter tuning, the best performance (around 60% R-squared) was achieved by linear regression.  The error analysis still reveals a high percentage of extreme errors (around 73%), indicating that this segment requires further investigation.


### 5. Analyzing Errors in the "Young" Segment

We perform a similar error analysis as before, comparing feature distributions in the extreme error subset with the overall `df_young` dataset.


```python
# Code for error analysis and distribution comparison, as in the previous lecture,
# but using the 'df_young' dataset and the model trained on this segment.
```

The analysis reveals that the errors are distributed across all feature values within the younger age group, suggesting that the existing features are insufficient to explain the variance in premiums for this segment.

### 6. Next Steps for the "Young" Segment

To improve the model's performance on the younger segment, we have two primary options:

* **Feature Engineering:** Explore new features or transformations of existing features that might better capture the underlying relationships for this demographic.  This might involve creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or domain-specific features.

* **Collect More Data:**  If feature engineering is insufficient, collecting more data, especially for the younger age group, could provide the model with more information to learn from and improve its predictive accuracy.  This could involve gathering more detailed information about lifestyle, health conditions, or other relevant factors.


By segmenting the data and training specialized models, we significantly improved performance for the "rest" segment and isolated the challenges within the "young" segment.  This targeted approach allows us to focus our efforts on improving the model for the specific demographic where it struggles, ultimately leading to a more robust and accurate overall prediction system.

## Lecture Article: Incorporating Genetic Risk and Finalizing Model Training

This lecture details incorporating a new feature, "genetic risk," into our model for the young population segment and finalizing the models for both young and rest segments for deployment.

### 1. Integrating Genetic Risk Data

We received a new dataset containing genetic risk information for the young population. We'll incorporate this feature into our existing model for this segment.

```python
# Create a copy of the existing "young" notebook and load the new data
# ... (Code for creating a copy of the notebook is platform-specific and not included here)

df_young_gr = pd.read_excel("Premiums_Young_with_GR.xlsx")
```

This code loads the new dataset, which includes the 'genetic_risk' column.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Genetic Risk

We perform EDA on the new feature to understand its distribution and relationship with the target variable.

```python
# Box plot for outlier detection
sns.boxplot(x=df_young_gr['genetic_risk'])
plt.show()

# Distribution plot
sns.histplot(df_young_gr['genetic_risk'], kde=True)
plt.show()

# Scatter plot against premium amount
plt.scatter(df_young_gr['genetic_risk'], df_young_gr['premium_amount'])
plt.xlabel("Genetic Risk")
plt.ylabel("Premium Amount")
plt.show()

# Update visualizations for five numeric features (including genetic risk)
# ... (Code for updating visualizations, potentially using ChatGPT as demonstrated in the original text)
```

These visualizations help identify potential outliers, understand the distribution of genetic risk, and confirm its expected positive correlation with premium amounts.

### 3. Model Training with Genetic Risk

We incorporate the `genetic_risk` feature into our model training pipeline.

```python
# Include 'genetic_risk' in correlation analysis
corr_matrix = df_young_gr.corr()
print(corr_matrix)

# Include 'genetic_risk' in feature scaling
columns_to_scale.append('genetic_risk') # Assuming 'columns_to_scale' is defined earlier

# ... (Rest of the preprocessing and model training code, similar to previous lectures)
```

Including `genetic_risk` in the preprocessing and model training steps ensures that the model leverages this new information.  Remarkably, adding this single feature significantly improved the model's performance for the young segment, increasing the R-squared score from 60% to 98%.


### 4. Error Analysis with Genetic Risk

We repeat the error analysis process to assess the impact of the new feature on prediction errors.

```python
# ... (Error analysis code, as in the previous lecture)
```

The error analysis reveals a dramatic reduction in extreme errors for the young segment, from 73% down to 2%. This confirms the value of the `genetic_risk` feature.

### 5.  Handling the "Rest" Segment with Genetic Risk

While we currently lack genetic risk data for the "rest" segment, we prepare our model for future inclusion of this feature.  We add a dummy `genetic_risk` column (with a placeholder value like 0 or -1) to the "rest" dataset and include it in the preprocessing and model training pipeline.  This ensures consistency between the models and simplifies future integration of genetic risk data for this segment.

```python
df_rest['genetic_risk'] = -1 # Adding a dummy column

# Include 'genetic_risk' in feature scaling for the "rest" model as well
# ... (Rest of the preprocessing and model training code for the "rest" segment)

```

### 6. Exporting the Final Models and Scaler

We export the trained models and the scaler object for both segments for later use in deployment.

```python
import joblib
import os

# Create an 'artifacts' directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists("artifacts"):
    os.makedirs("artifacts")


# Export the "young" model and scaler
joblib.dump(best_model_young, "artifacts/model_young.joblib") # 'best_model_young' is the trained model for the young segment
scaler_with_columns = {'scaler': scaler, 'columns': columns_to_scale}
joblib.dump(scaler_with_columns, "artifacts/scaler.joblib")  # Using the same scaler for both models


# Export the "rest" model
joblib.dump(best_model_rest, "artifacts/model_rest.joblib") # 'best_model_rest' is the trained model for the rest segment

```

This code saves the trained models and the scaler object to the `artifacts` directory.  We use the same scaler object for both models to maintain consistency.

### 7. Conclusion

By incorporating genetic risk and performing model segmentation, we achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy, especially for the young population.  Exporting the final models and scaler prepares us for the next stage: building a user interface and deploying the models using Streamlit.
