# Introduction

I've recently joined Maven Fuzzy Factory as an eCommerce Database Analyst, where I'm part of the startup team working closely with the CEO, Head of Marketing, and Website Manager. Our primary focus is to navigate the online retail space, analyze marketing channels, optimize website performance, and measure the impact of our new product launches.

# Data Information

Our database plays a pivotal role in our analysis and decision-making processes. It consists of six key tables:

1. **website_sessions**: This table holds essential information about website sessions, including details like session duration, user source, campaign, device type, and referral sources.

2. **website_pageviews**: Here, we store data related to website page views, tracking user activity across our web pages.

3. **products**: This table is dedicated to our product catalog, containing valuable data about our products, including their names and creation dates.

4. **orders**: We keep track of all customer orders in this table, capturing data on order IDs, website sessions, user IDs, primary products, items purchased, prices, and costs.

5. **order_items**: Each order can consist of multiple items, and this table stores the details of these items, such as product IDs, prices, and costs.

6. **order_item_refunds**: In case of any refunds, we meticulously record refund data here, including refund amounts and their associations with orders and items.

As we dive deeper into the data, my goal is to become the data expert for Maven Fuzzy Factory, providing mission-critical analyses that help drive our business forward and achieve our goals.

## Traffic Source Analysis

In the realm of eCommerce, understanding where your customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic is paramount. This analysis focuses on leveraging the UTM parameters stored in our database to identify paid website sessions and determine the revenue generated by these paid campaigns.

**1. Identifying Traffic Sources**

We commence by exploring the size of various traffic sources, primarily examining the UTM content that drives the most sessions within the specified dataset range.

```sql
SELECT utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM   website_sessions
WHERE  website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions |
|-------------|----------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      |
| null        | 18       |
| g_ad_2      | 6        |
| b_ad_2      | 2        |

In this context, 'g_ad_1' stands out as the dominant traffic source, driving 975 sessions. Null entries are also present, representing traffic without specific UTM content, totaling 18 sessions. Additionally, 'g_ad_2' and 'b_ad_2' contribute smaller session counts.

**2. Linking Traffic Sources to Orders**

Next, we expand our analysis to link these traffic sources to orders, gaining insights into how effectively these sources convert sessions into actual orders.

```sql
SELECT a.utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)           AS orders
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY a.utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions | orders |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      | 35     |
| null        | 18       | 0      |
| g_ad_2      | 6        | 0      |
| b_ad_2      | 2        | 0      |

Unsurprisingly, 'g_ad_1' still leads in sessions with 975, contributing 35 orders. However, it's notable that 'null,' 'g_ad_2,' and 'b_ad_2' did not result in any orders during this period.

**3. Session-to-Order Conversion Rate**

To provide a comprehensive view, we calculate the session-to-order conversion rate for each traffic source.

```sql
SELECT a.utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id)    AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)              AS orders,
       Round(( Count(DISTINCT b.order_id) / Count(DISTINCT
             a.website_session_id) ) * 100, 2) AS sess_ord_conv_rate
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY a.utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions | orders | sess_ord_conv_rate |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      | 35     | 3.59               |
| null        | 18       | 0      | 0.00               |
| g_ad_2      | 6        | 0      | 0.00               |
| b_ad_2      | 2        | 0      | 0.00               |

When assessing the session-to-order conversion rates, 'g_ad_1' shows a rate of 3.59%. The other sources, including 'null,' 'g_ad_2,' and 'b_ad_2,' did not yield any conversions during this analyzed period.

In summary, this analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of various traffic sources in driving sessions and orders, with 'g_ad_1' being the most significant contributor to both sessions and orders. Understanding these conversion rates is crucial for optimizing our marketing strategies and improving the overall business performance.

**Analysis of Website Sessions – UTM Source Breakdown**

**Request Explanation:**
Cindy, the date requested is April 12, 2012. The objective is to gain insights into the bulk of website sessions leading up to that date, specifically focusing on the breakdown by UTM source, campaign, and referring domain if available.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
select utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer, count(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions
from website_sessions
where created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer
ORDER BY sessions DESC;
```

**SQL Query Explanation:**

1. `select utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer, count(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions`: This part of the query selects the relevant columns from the `website_sessions` table, including UTM content, UTM campaign, HTTP referer, and calculates the count of distinct website session IDs, which represents the number of sessions.

2. `from website_sessions`: It specifies the source table from which the data is retrieved, which is the `website_sessions` table.

3. `where created_at < '2012-04-12'`: This clause filters the data based on the `created_at` column, ensuring that only records with a creation date before April 12, 2012, are included in the analysis.

4. `GROUP BY utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer`: This clause groups the data by UTM content, UTM campaign, and HTTP referer, allowing for a breakdown of sessions by these parameters.

5. `ORDER BY sessions DESC`: The results are then ordered in descending order based on the number of sessions, with the most significant number of sessions appearing first in the output.

**Result:**

| utm_content | utm_campaign | http_referer            | sessions |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|----------|
| g_ad_1      | nonbrand     | https://www.gsearch.com | 3613     |
|             |              |                         | 28       |
|             |              | https://www.gsearch.com | 27       |
| g_ad_2      | brand        | https://www.gsearch.com | 26       |
|             | 7            | https://www.bsearch.com |          |
| b_ad_2      | brand        | https://www.bsearch.com | 7        |

**Interpretation:**

The provided data showcases a comprehensive breakdown of website sessions, sorted by UTM source, campaign, and referring domain. It's apparent that 'g_ad_1' nonbrand sessions from 'https://www.gsearch.com' dominate with 3613 sessions. Notably, there are several entries with null values for UTM content and campaign, which collectively contribute 28 sessions.

**Follow-up:**

As we observe the dominance of 'g_ad_1' nonbrand sessions, it is advisable to conduct a more detailed analysis of this particular source to identify optimization opportunities. To gain further insights and establish next steps, involving Tom for his expertise is a practical course of action.

**Request:**

Tom wants to determine the conversion rate (CVR) from website sessions to orders, specifically focusing on sessions generated through the "gsearch" source with a "nonbrand" campaign. The goal is to calculate whether the CVR meets the minimum threshold of 4% needed to make the financial numbers work. If the CVR is below this threshold, adjustments to reduce search bids might be necessary. Tom's request aims to evaluate the economic viability of their paid search campaigns.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id)    AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)              AS orders,
       Round(( Count(DISTINCT b.order_id) / Count(DISTINCT
             a.website_session_id) ) * 100, 2) AS CVR
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.created_at < '2012-04-14' 
       AND utm_source = "gsearch"
       AND utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
ORDER  BY 3 DESC; 
```

**SQL Query Explanation:**
- The query calculates the CVR by counting the number of distinct website sessions and orders.
- It computes the CVR by dividing the number of orders by the number of sessions and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.
- The query filters data based on the "gsearch" source and "nonbrand" campaign to focus on sessions from this specific marketing channel.
- Results are sorted in descending order based on the CVR.

**Answer:**
| # sessions | orders | CVR  |
|------------|--------|------|
| 3895       | 112    | 2.88 |

**Answer Interpretation:**
The analysis shows that the CVR for sessions generated through the "gsearch" source with a "nonbrand" campaign is approximately 2.88%. This CVR falls short of the 4% threshold needed to make the economics work for the paid search campaigns. Consequently, there is a need to reduce search bids since the current conversion rate indicates that they are over-spending.

**Comment by Tom:**
Tom acknowledges the analysis and mentions that, based on the findings, they need to dial down their search bids. The reason for this is that they are currently over-spending on their campaigns due to the lower-than-desired conversion rate. The analysis has helped them make more cost-effective decisions and saved them money.

**Request:**

The answer shows a portion of the `website_pageviews` table, indicating the website pages visited during specific sessions.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Top-Content analysis [pages with most views]
select pageview_url, count(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) as pageviews
from website_pageviews
where website_pageview_id < 1000
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

This SQL query aims to identify the most viewed website pages. It counts the distinct `website_pageview_id` values for each `pageview_url`, filtering only the records where `website_pageview_id` is less than 1000. The results are then grouped by `pageview_url` and ordered by the count of pageviews in descending order.

**Answer:**

| # pageview_url            | pageviews |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| /home                     | 523       |
| /products                 | 195       |
| /the-original-mr-fuzzy    | 134       |
| /cart                     | 56        |
| /shipping                 | 39        |
| /billing                  | 34        |
| /thank-you-for-your-order | 18        |

The answer table displays the website pages with the most views (pageview_url) and the respective count of pageviews. The "/home" page is the most visited, with 523 pageviews.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Top ENTRY Pages
with
cte1 as(select website_session_id, min(website_pageview_id) as first_entry
from website_pageviews
where website_pageview_id < 1000
GROUP BY 1)
SELECT b.pageview_url, count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id ) as number_of_times_first_entered from cte1 a
left join website_pageviews b on a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

**Explanation:**

This SQL query focuses on identifying the top entry pages. It utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `cte1` to find the first pageview (`first_entry`) for each session (`website_session_id`) from the `website_pageviews` table where `website_pageview_id` is less than 1000. It then joins the CTE with the `website_pageviews` table to find the pageview_url of the first entry. The results are grouped by `pageview_url`, and the count of distinct sessions is calculated to show how many times each page served as the entry point.

**Answer:**

| # pageview_url | number_of_times_first_entered |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| /home          | 523                           |

The answer table presents the pageview_url that served as the entry point the most, which is "/home," with 523 occurrences.

In summary, this analysis provides insights into the most popular pages on the website, with "/home" being the top-viewed page and the most frequently used entry point. This information can be valuable for optimizing and tailoring content and strategies to meet user preferences and business objectives.

**Request - June 09, 2012:**

Hi there!
I’m Morgan, the new Website Manager.
Could you help me get my head around the site by pulling the most-viewed website pages, ranked by session volume?
Thanks!
-Morgan

**SQL Query:**

```sql
select pageview_url,
count(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) as sessions
from website_pageviews
where created_at < '2012-06-09'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

In this request, Morgan, the Website Manager, asks for assistance in understanding the most-viewed website pages, ranked by session volume. The SQL query retrieves data from the `website_pageviews` table, counting the number of distinct session IDs for each `pageview_url` before June 9, 2012. The results are grouped by `pageview_url` and ordered by the count of sessions in descending order.

**Answer:**

| # pageview_url            | sessions |
|---------------------------|----------|
| /home                     | 10403    |
| /products                 | 4239     |
| /the-original-mr-fuzzy    | 3037     |
| /cart                     | 1306     |
| /shipping                 | 869      |
| /billing                  | 716      |
| /thank-you-for-your-order | 306      |

The answer table provides a list of the most-viewed website pages, with session counts. It reveals that the homepage ("/home") received the highest number of sessions, followed by the products page and the Mr. Fuzzy page.

**Comment**
Thank you! It definitely seems like the homepage, the products page, and the Mr. Fuzzy page get the bulk of our traffic. I would like to understand traffic patterns more. I’ll follow up soon with a request to look at entry pages. Thanks! -Morgan

**Request - June 12, 2012:**

Hi there! Would you be able to pull a list of the top entry pages? I want to confirm where our users are hitting the site. If you could pull all entry pages and rank them on entry volume, that would be great. Thanks! -Morgan

**SQL Query:**

```sql
with
cte1 as(select website_session_id, min(website_pageview_id) as first_entry
from website_pageviews
where created_at < '2012-06-12'
GROUP BY 1)
SELECT b.pageview_url, count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id ) as number_of_times_first_entered from cte1 a
left join website_pageviews b on a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

**Explanation:**

In the second request, Morgan seeks to understand the entry points of website users. The SQL query first creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `cte1`, which identifies the first entry page (`first_entry`) for each session before June 12, 2012. It groups the results by `website_session_id`. The main query then joins this CTE with the `website_pageviews` table to determine which pages users first enter and calculates the count of distinct sessions for each entry page.

**Answer:**

| # pageview_url | number_of_times_first_entered |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| /home          | 10714                         |

The answer table displays the top entry pages ranked by entry volume. In this case, the homepage ("/home") is the primary entry point, with 10,714 instances.

**Comment:**
In the comment following the second request, Morgan acknowledges that all the website traffic comes in through the homepage. They find it quite obvious that this is the area where they should focus on making improvements, and they hint at the possibility of follow-up requests to examine the performance of the homepage. It shows an understanding of the importance of the homepage as the initial point of interaction with users and the potential for optimization in that area. Morgan's request and comments suggest a proactive approach to website management and improvement.

## LANDING PAGE PERFORMANCE & TESTING:

The goal of this SQL analysis is to evaluate the performance of landing pages during a specific time period. The analysis involves multiple steps:
1. Finding the first website pageview for relevant sessions.
2. Identifying the landing page for each session.
3. Counting pageviews for each session to identify "bounces" (sessions where users viewed only one page).
4. Summarizing the total sessions and bounced sessions, categorized by landing pages.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH
-- First website_pageview_id for relevant sessions
cte1 AS (
    SELECT website_session_id, MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_entry
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-02-01'
    GROUP BY 1
),
-- Identifying the landing page of each session
cte2 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, b.pageview_url AS landing_page
    FROM cte1 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
),
-- Counting pageviews for each session to identify "bounces"
cte3 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.landing_page, COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) AS count_of_pages_viewed
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
    HAVING COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) = 1
),
-- Merging all sessions and bounced sessions in a single table
cte4 AS (
    SELECT a.landing_page, a.website_session_id, b.website_session_id AS bounced_website_session_id
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN cte3 b ON a.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
    ORDER BY a.website_session_id
)
-- Summarizing the total sessions and bounced sessions, by Landing Pages
SELECT landing_page,
       COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions,
       ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS bounced_cvr
FROM cte4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY bounced_cvr DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **cte1:** The first Common Table Expression (CTE) `cte1` identifies the first pageview (`first_entry`) for each relevant session that occurred between January 1, 2014, and February 1, 2014.

2. **cte2:** The second CTE `cte2` associates each session with its landing page by joining the first pageview URL with the session ID.

3. **cte3:** The third CTE `cte3` counts the number of pageviews for each session, and only includes sessions where users viewed just one page, indicating a "bounce."

4. **cte4:** The fourth CTE `cte4` merges all sessions with their bounced sessions by joining `cte2` and `cte3`.

5. The final query summarizes the data. It groups the results by landing pages and calculates the total sessions, bounced sessions, and the bounce rate (bounced_cvr) as a percentage of total sessions.

**Answer:**

| # landing_page | sessions | bounced_sessions | bounced_cvr |
|----------------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| /lander-3      | 4232     | 2606             | 61.58       |
| /lander-2      | 6500     | 2855             | 43.92       |
| /home          | 4093     | 1575             | 38.48       |
| /products      | 1        | 0                | 0.00        |

The answer table provides landing page performance data for the specified time period. It includes the landing page URLs, the number of sessions, the number of bounced sessions, and the bounce rate. The landing page "/lander-3" has the highest bounce rate at 61.58%, followed by "/lander-2" at 43.92%. The homepage "/home" and "/products" have lower bounce rates.

This analysis helps in understanding how well landing pages are retaining users, and it highlights areas that may need improvement to reduce bounce rates and increase user engagement.

**Request (June 14, 2012):**
Morgan requested information about the performance of the landing page, specifically the homepage. They wanted to know the sessions, bounced sessions, and the bounce rate for traffic landing on the homepage.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH
-- First website_pageview_id for relevant sessions
cte1 AS (
    SELECT website_session_id, MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_entry
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE created_at < '2012-06-14'
    GROUP BY 1
),
-- Identifying the landing page of each session
cte2 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, b.pageview_url AS landing_page
    FROM cte1 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
),
-- Counting pageviews for each session to identify "bounces"
cte3 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.landing_page, COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) AS count_of_pages_viewed
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
    HAVING COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) = 1
),
-- Merging all sessions and bounced sessions in a single table
cte4 AS (
    SELECT a.landing_page, a.website_session_id, b.website_session_id AS bounced_website_session_id
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN cte3 b ON a.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
    ORDER BY a.website_session_id
)
-- Summarizing the total sessions and bounced sessions, by Landing Pages
SELECT landing_page,
       COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions,
       ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS bounced_cvr
FROM cte4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY bounced_cvr DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
The SQL query begins by identifying the first website pageview for relevant sessions within a specified time period. It then associates each session with its landing page and counts pageviews to identify bounced sessions (sessions with only one pageview). The data is summarized for the homepage, showing the number of sessions, bounced sessions, and the bounce rate.

**Answer:**

| # landing_page | sessions | bounced_sessions | bounced_cvr |
|----------------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| /home          | 11048    | 6538             | 59.18       |

The answer table provides the requested information for the homepage. The homepage "/home" had a total of 11,048 sessions, out of which 6,538 sessions resulted in bounces, resulting in a bounce rate of 59.18%.

**Comment by the Requester:**
Morgan acknowledges the high bounce rate of almost 60% and expresses concern about the quality of paid search traffic. They plan to create a custom landing page for search and set up an experiment to analyze its performance with the help of more data. The comment indicates that Morgan intends to take actions to improve the bounce rate on the homepage.

**Request (July 28, 2012):**
Morgan requested bounce rate information for two specific landing pages, "/home" and "/lander-1." These pages were part of a 50/50 test for gsearch nonbrand traffic. Morgan wanted to evaluate the new page, "/lander-1," by comparing the bounce rates for the two pages during the time period when "/lander-1" was receiving traffic.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Finding out the /lander-1 first view date
SELECT created_at, Min(website_pageview_id)
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = "/lander-1"
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 1;

WITH
-- First website_pageview_id for relevant sessions
cte1 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, Min(a.website_pageview_id) AS first_entry
    FROM website_pageviews a
    INNER JOIN website_sessions b
    ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    AND b.created_at > '2012-06-19'
    AND b.created_at < '2012-07-28'
    AND b.utm_source = "gsearch"
    AND b.utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
    GROUP BY 1
),
-- Identifying the landing page of each session
cte2 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, b.pageview_url AS landing_page
    FROM cte1 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
),
-- Counting pageviews for each session to identify "bounces"
cte3 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.landing_page, COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) AS count_of_pages_viewed
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
    HAVING COUNT(b.website_pageview_id) = 1
),
-- Merging all sessions and bounced sessions in a single table
cte4 AS (
    SELECT a.landing_page, a.website_session_id, b.website_session_id AS bounced_website_session_id
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN cte3 b ON a.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
    ORDER BY a.website_session_id
)
-- Summarizing the total sessions and bounced sessions, by Landing Pages
SELECT landing_page,
       COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions,
       ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_website_session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS bounce_rate
FROM cte4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY bounce_rate DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
The SQL query begins by identifying the first view date of the "/lander-1" landing page. It then calculates the bounce rates for both "/home" and "/lander-1" landing pages during the specified time period and for gsearch nonbrand traffic. The bounce rate is calculated as the percentage of bounced sessions out of the total sessions.

**Answer:**

| # landing_page | sessions | bounced_sessions | bounce_rate |
|----------------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| /home          | 2261     | 1319             | 58.34       |
| /lander-1      | 2316     | 1233             | 53.24       |

The answer table provides the requested information for the two landing pages. For "/home," there were 2,261 sessions with 1,319 bounced sessions, resulting in a bounce rate of 58.34%. For "/lander-1," there were 2,316 sessions with 1,233 bounced sessions, resulting in a lower bounce rate of 53.24%.

**Comment by the Requester:**
Morgan expresses satisfaction with the results, noting that the custom landing page "/lander-1" has a lower bounce rate, indicating success. Morgan plans to update campaigns to direct all nonbrand paid traffic to the new page. They also express the intention to have trends analyzed in a few weeks to ensure that things have moved in the right direction.

**Request (August 31, 2012):**
Morgan requested data related to paid search nonbrand traffic landing on two pages, "/home" and "/lander-1," trended weekly since June 1st. The goal was to confirm that the traffic routing was correct and to assess the impact of the change on the overall paid search bounce rate.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH
-- First website_pageview_id for relevant sessions
cte1 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, Min(a.website_pageview_id) AS first_entry, a.created_at

    INNER JOIN website_sessions b
    ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    AND a.created_at > '2012-06-01'
    AND a.created_at < '2012-08-31'
    AND b.utm_source = "gsearch"
    AND b.utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
    GROUP BY 1, 3
),
-- Identifying the landing page of each session
cte2 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.first_entry, b.pageview_url AS landing_page, a.created_at
    FROM cte1 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.first_entry = b.website_pageview_id
),
-- Counting pageviews for each session to identify "bounces"
cte3 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.first_entry, a.landing_page, Count(b.website_pageview_id) AS count_of_pages_viewed, a.created_at
    FROM cte2 a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2, 5
)
-- Summarizing the total sessions and bounced sessions, by Landing Pages
SELECT Min(Date(created_at)) AS week_start,
       Round(( Count(DISTINCT CASE WHEN count_of_pages_viewed = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / Count(DISTINCT website_session_id) ) * 100, 2) AS bounce_rate,
       Count(DISTINCT CASE WHEN landing_page = "/home" THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS home_sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT CASE WHEN landing_page = "/lander-1" THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS lander1_sessions
FROM cte3
GROUP BY Yearweek(created_at);
```

**Explanation:**
The SQL query retrieves data for two landing pages, "/home" and "/lander-1," and trends it weekly since June 1st for paid search nonbrand traffic. The query calculates the bounce rate, home sessions, and "/lander-1" sessions. Data is grouped by week using the `Yearweek` function.

**Answer:**

| # week_start | bounce_rate | home_sessions | lander1_sessions |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|

| 2012-08-26   | 53.78       | 0             | 833              |

The answer table provides the requested data, showing the trend for each week. It includes the weekly start date, bounce rate, home sessions, and "/lander-1" sessions.

**Comment by the Requester:**
Morgan expresses gratitude for the provided data, indicating that both pages received traffic for a while and the full switch to the custom lander was successful. They also note that the overall bounce rate has decreased over time, which is considered positive. Morgan mentions plans for a deep dive into the site and hints at future requests.

## ANALYZING & TESTING CONVERSION FUNNELS:

Conversion funnel analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding and optimizing the user journey towards making a purchase or completing a specific action on a website. It involves examining the steps in the conversion flow to evaluate how many users progress through each step and how many drop off at each stage. This analysis helps businesses identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement in their conversion process.

**Business Context:**

The request seeks to perform a mini conversion funnel analysis from the "/lander-2" page to the "/cart" page. The primary objectives are to determine the number of users who reach each step in the funnel and calculate drop-off rates. This analysis is specifically focused on the "/lander-2" traffic and customers who have an interest in a product named "Mr. Fuzzy."

**SQL Query 1 (Counting Users at Each Funnel Step):**

```sql
WITH
-- Step 1: Select All Pageviews for Relevant Sessions (CTE1)
cte1 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, b.pageview_url, b.created_at as pageview_created_at,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/products' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS product_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS mrfuzzy_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS cart_page
    FROM website_sessions a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
    WHERE a.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-02-01'
    AND b.pageview_url IN ('/lander-2', '/products', '/the-original-mr-fuzzy', '/cart')
    ORDER BY 1, 3
),
-- Step 2: Identify Each Relevant Pageview as a Funnel Step (CTE2)
cte2 AS (
    SELECT website_session_id, MAX(product_page) AS product_made_it, MAX(mrfuzzy_page) AS mrfuzzy_made_it, MAX(cart_page) AS cart_made_it
    FROM cte1
    GROUP BY 1
)
-- Step 3: Create the Session-Level Conversion Funnel View (Main Query)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_product,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_mrfuzzy,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cart_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_cart
FROM cte2;
```

**Explanation of Query 1:**

1. **Step 1 (CTE1)** selects relevant pageviews for sessions within the specified date range and matching specific pageview URLs that correspond to the conversion funnel steps. It assigns binary values to each pageview URL to track if a session reached a specific step.

2. **Step 2 (CTE2)** summarizes the data by grouping it based on the website session. It calculates binary values for each session, indicating whether they reached the '/products,' '/the-original-mr-fuzzy,' and '/cart' pages.

3. **Step 3 (Main Query)** calculates the following metrics:
   - `sessions`: The total number of distinct sessions that meet the criteria.
   - `to_product`: The number of sessions that reached the '/products' page (the first step of the funnel).
   - `to_mrfuzzy`: The number of sessions that reached the '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' page (the second step of the funnel).
   - `to_cart`: The number of sessions that reached the '/cart' page (the final step of the funnel).

**Answer Table for Query 1:**

| # sessions | to_product | to_mrfuzzy | to_cart |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 10644      | 7789       | 4777       | 2889    |

- `sessions`: 10,644 sessions were considered in the analysis.
- `to_product`: 7,789 sessions progressed to the '/products' page.
- `to_mrfuzzy`: 4,777 sessions reached the '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' page.
- `to_cart`: 2,889 sessions advanced to the '/cart' page.

**SQL Query 2 (Calculating Click-Through Rates):**

```sql
WITH
-- Reusing the CTE1 and CTE2 from Query 1
-- Step 3: Create the Session-Level Conversion Funnel View (Main Query)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS lander_clickthrough_rate,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)) * 100, 2) AS product_clickthrough_rate,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cart_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)) * 100, 2) AS mrfuzzy_clickthrough_rate
FROM cte2;
```

**Explanation of Query 2:**

This query is a continuation of the analysis, using the same CTEs (CTE1 and CTE2) established in Query 1. It calculates click-through rates for each step of the conversion funnel.

- `lander-clickthrough_rate`: The click-through rate from '/lander-2' to '/products.'
- `product-clickthrough_rate`: The click-through rate from '/products' to '/the-original-mr-fuzzy.'
- `mrfuzzy-clickthrough_rate`: The click-through rate from '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' to '/cart.'

**Answer Table for Query 2:**

| # sessions | lander_clickthrough_rate | product_clickthrough_rate | mrfuzzy_clickthrough_rate |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 10644      | 73.18                    | 61.33                     | 60.48                     |

- `sessions`: 10,644 sessions are part of the analysis.
- `lander-clickthrough_rate`: The click-through rate from '/lander-2' to '/products' is 73.18%.
- `product-clickthrough_rate`: The click-through rate from '/products' to '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' is 61.33%.
- `mrfuzzy-clickthrough-rate`: The click-through rate from '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' to '/cart' is 60.48%.

**Interpretation:**

- The analysis in Query 1 provides insights into the number of users at each step of the conversion funnel. It identifies the drop-off rates as users progress through the funnel.
- The analysis in Query 2 calculates click-through rates, which are essential for understanding the effectiveness of guiding users through each step of the funnel.

In summary, these SQL queries and the resulting tables help assess and optimize the conversion funnel's performance for "/lander-2" traffic, particularly for users interested in "Mr. Fuzzy." The click-through rates indicate how well users are transitioning from one step to the next in the funnel.

**Request (September 5, 2012):**

Morgan, the requester, is interested in understanding the user journey of "gsearch" visitors on their website, specifically, how visitors navigate from the "/lander-1" page to placing an order. The objective is to create a full conversion funnel analysis, breaking down how many customers successfully complete each step of the process. The analysis should start at the "/lander-1" page and encompass the entire journey to the "thank you" page. The data used for this analysis spans from August 5th to September 5th, 2012.

**SQL Query 1 (Counting Users at Each Funnel Step):**

```sql
WITH
-- Step 1: Select All Pageviews for Relevant Sessions (CTE1)
cte1 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, b.pageview_url, b.created_at as pageview_created_at,

    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS mrfuzzy_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS cart_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/shipping' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS shipping_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/billing' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS billing_page,
    CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/thank-you-for-your-order' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS thanks_page
    FROM website_sessions a
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews b ON a.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
    WHERE a.created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-05' AND '2012-09-05'
    AND utm_source = "gsearch"
    AND utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
    AND b.pageview_url IN ('/lander-1', '/products', '/the-original-mr-fuzzy', '/cart', '/shipping', '/billing', '/thank-you-for-your-order')

    MAX(cart_page) AS cart_made_it,
    MAX(shipping_page) AS shipping_made_it,
    MAX(billing_page) AS billing_made_it,
    MAX(thanks_page) AS thanks_made_it
    FROM cte1
    GROUP BY 1
)
-- Step 3: Create the Session-Level Conversion Funnel View (Main Query)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_product,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_mrfuzzy,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cart_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_cart,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN shipping_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_shipping,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN billing_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_billing,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN thanks_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS to_thanks
FROM cte2;
```

**Explanation of Query 1:**

1. **Step 1 (CTE1)** selects relevant pageviews for sessions within the specified date range, focusing on "gsearch" visitors who arrived via the "nonbrand" campaign. It matches specific pageview URLs that correspond to the conversion funnel steps and assigns binary values to track if a session reached a particular step.

2. **Step 2 (CTE2)** summarizes the data by grouping it based on the website session. It calculates binary values for each session, indicating whether they reached the '/products,' '/the-original-mr-fuzzy,' '/cart,' '/shipping,' '/billing,' and '/thank-you-for-your-order' pages.

3. **Step 3 (Main Query)** calculates the following metrics:
   - `sessions`: The total number of distinct sessions that meet the criteria.
   - `to_product`: The number of sessions that reached the '/products' page (the first step of the funnel).
   - `to_mrfuzzy`: The number of sessions that reached the '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' page.
   - `to_cart`: The number of sessions that reached the '/cart' page.
   - `to_shipping`: The number of sessions that reached the '/shipping' page.
   - `to_billing`: The number of sessions that reached the '/billing' page.
   - `to_thanks`: The number of sessions that reached the '/thank-you-for-your-order' page (the final step of the funnel).

**ANSWER:**

| # sessions | to_product | to_mrfuzzy | to_cart | to_shipping | to_billing | to_thanks |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 4493       | 2115       | 1567       | 683     | 455         | 361        | 158       |

**SQL Query 2 (Calculating Click-Through Rates):**

```sql

-- Reusing the CTE1 and CTE2 from Query 1
-- Step 3: Create the Session-Level Conversion Funnel View (Main Query)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) * 100), 2) AS lander_clickthrough_rate,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) * 100), 2) AS product_clickthrough_rate,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cart_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN mrfuzzy_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) * 100), 2) AS mrfuzzy_clickthrough_rate,

ade_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) * 100), 2) AS billing_clickthrough_rate
FROM cte2;
```

**Explanation of Query 2:**

This query calculates the click-through rates between each step of the conversion funnel. It builds upon the CTEs created in Query 1.

- `lander_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that proceed from "/lander-1" to "/products."
- `product_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that progress from "/products" to "/the-original-mr-fuzzy," relative to those who reached "/products."
- `mrfuzzy_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that advance from "/the-original-mr-fuzzy" to "/cart," relative to those who reached "/the-original-mr-fuzzy."
- `cart_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that continue from "/cart" to "/shipping," relative to those who reached "/cart."
- `shipping_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that move from "/shipping" to "/billing," relative to those who reached "/shipping."
- `billing_clickthrough_rate`: The percentage of sessions that reach the "/thank-you-for-your-order" page after "/billing," relative to those who reached "/billing."

**ANSWER:**

| # sessions | lander_clickthrough_rate | product_clickthrough_rate | mrfuzzy_clickthrough_rate | cart_clickthrough_rate | shipping_clickthrough_rate | billing_clickthrough_rate |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 4493       | 47.07                    | 74.09                     | 43.59                     | 66.62                  | 79.34                      | 43.77                     |

**Interpretation of the Answers:**

- Out of 4,493 sessions initiated at "/lander-1," 2,115 sessions proceeded to the "/products" page (to_product).
- Subsequently, 1,567 sessions reached the "/the-original-mr-fuzzy" page (to_mrfuzzy).
- Of those, 683 sessions made it to the "/cart" page (to_cart).
- The funnel continues, with 455 sessions reaching the "/shipping" page (to_shipping).
- 361 sessions progressed to the "/billing" page (to_billing).
- Finally, 158 sessions successfully completed the funnel, landing on the "/thank-you-for-your-order" page (to_thanks).

**Comment by the Requester:**

The requester's comment in the initial email expressed the desire to understand where visitors arriving from "gsearch" lose interest in their website. The request specifically asked for a full conversion funnel analysis to track the number of customers at each step of the process. The data used for analysis spans from August 5th to September 5th, 2012.

The analysis enables the requester to pinpoint which step in the conversion process has the highest drop-off rate, providing insights for optimization and potential improvements.

**Request (November 10, 2012):**

Morgan, the requester, inquired about the effectiveness of an updated billing page, denoted as "/billing-2," compared to the original "/billing" page. The objective was to determine what percentage of sessions on these pages ultimately led to a successful order placement. It's worth noting that this test encompassed all website traffic, not just "gsearch" visitors. The request was made on November 10, 2012.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
-- First, finding the starting point to frame the analysis
SELECT MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_entry 
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/billing-2';
-- 53550 is the first entry pageview id

WITH
-- CTE1: Joining Website Pageviews and Orders
cte1 AS (
    SELECT a.website_session_id, a.pageview_url AS billing_version_seen, b.order_id
    FROM website_pageviews a
    LEFT JOIN orders b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
    WHERE a.created_at < '2012-11-10' -- Time of assignment
    AND a.website_pageview_id >= 53550 -- First pageview id
    AND a.pageview_url IN ('/billing', '/billing-2')
)
-- Main Query: Calculate Billing Page Conversion Metrics
SELECT billing_version_seen,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS billing_order_rt
FROM cte1
GROUP BY billing_version_seen;
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

The SQL query's purpose is to compare the performance of two billing pages, "/billing" and "/billing-2," in terms of their ability to convert visitors into customers.

1. The initial part of the query determines the starting point for the analysis. It identifies the earliest pageview ID for the "/billing-2" page. In this case, the first entry pageview ID is found to be 53550.

2. The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE), denoted as `cte1`, to join website pageviews and order data. It selects relevant sessions where pageviews occurred before November 10, 2012 (the time of assignment) and had a pageview ID greater than or equal to 53550. It filters the data for both "/billing" and "/billing-2" pages.

3. In the main part of the query, it calculates the following metrics for each billing page version:
   - `billing_version_seen`: Indicates the version of the billing page (either "/billing" or "/billing-2").
   - `sessions`: The count of distinct website sessions that viewed the respective billing page.
   - `orders`: The count of distinct orders placed by users who viewed the billing page.
   - `billing_order_rt`: The percentage of sessions that resulted in orders on the respective billing page.

**ANSWER:**

| # billing_version_seen | sessions | orders | billing_order_rt |
|------------------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| /billing               | 657      | 300    | 45.66            |
| /billing-2             | 654      | 410    | 62.69            |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The query yields the following results for the two billing page versions:

- For "/billing," there were 657 sessions, resulting in 300 orders, with a billing page order conversion rate of 45.66%.
- For "/billing-2," there were 654 sessions, resulting in 410 orders, with a billing page order conversion rate of 62.69%.

**Comment by the Requester (November 10, 2012):**

Morgan expresses enthusiasm upon receiving the results, as it indicates that the new billing page version ("/billing-2") is significantly outperforming the original billing page ("/billing") in converting customers. The requester plans to have the engineering team roll out the new billing page version to all customers immediately. Morgan acknowledges that the insights provided through this analysis have contributed to a substantial increase in revenue.

This comment reflects the positive impact of data-driven decision-making on the company's bottom line.

## Channel Portfolio Optimization
The concept here revolves around the optimization of a marketing channel portfolio. Analyzing a portfolio of marketing channels involves evaluating the performance of different channels, which can include various online advertising sources, social media platforms, or other marketing avenues. The goal is to use data-driven insights to allocate the marketing budget efficiently and maximize the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

**Request Explanation:**
The request is to analyze the performance of various marketing channels based on data related to website sessions and orders. The analysis focuses on a specific date range, from January 1, 2014, to February 1, 2014. The key metrics of interest are the number of sessions generated by each marketing channel, the number of orders placed through these sessions, and the conversion rate (CVR) for each channel.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT a.utm_content, COUNT(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT b.order_id) AS orders,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT b.order_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS cvr
FROM website_sessions a
LEFT JOIN orders b ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE a.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-02-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query retrieves and calculates metrics related to marketing channels. Here's how it works:

1. The `SELECT` statement extracts the `utm_content` (a parameter that can identify different marketing channels), the count of distinct website sessions, the count of distinct orders, and the conversion rate (CVR) for each channel.

2. The `FROM` clause specifies the source tables for the query, which are `website_sessions` (aliased as 'a') and `orders` (aliased as 'b'). The query performs a left join to connect sessions with orders based on the `website_session_id`.

3. The `WHERE` clause filters the data, restricting it to sessions created between January 1, 2014, and February 1, 2014.

4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `utm_content`, enabling the calculation of metrics for each marketing channel.

5. The `ORDER BY` clause arranges the results in descending order of the number of sessions to see which channels generated the most sessions.

**Answer Table:**

The query yields a table with the following columns and data:

| # utm_content | sessions | orders | cvr   |
|---------------|----------|--------|-------|
| g_ad_1        | 7500     | 543    | 7.24  |
|               | 2724     | 194    | 7.12  |
| social_ad_1   | 1618     | 17     | 1.05  |
| b_ad_1        | 1614     | 109    | 6.75  |
| g_ad_2        | 1107     | 91     | 8.22  |
| b_ad_2        | 262      | 29     | 11.07 |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table presents data for different marketing channels, focusing on the number of sessions, the number of orders, and the conversion rate (CVR) for each channel. Here's the interpretation of the results:

- **"g_ad_1"** generated the highest number of sessions, with 7,500 sessions, resulting in 543 orders and a CVR of 7.24%.
- An unidentified channel (blank entry) generated 2,724 sessions, with 194 orders and a CVR of 7.12%.
- **"social_ad_1"** resulted in 1,618 sessions but had a lower CVR of 1.05%, resulting in only 17 orders.
- **"b_ad_1"** contributed 1,614 sessions, 109 orders, and a CVR of 6.75%.
- **"g_ad_2"** generated 1,107 sessions with 91 orders, achieving a CVR of 8.22%.
- **"b_ad_2"** resulted in 262 sessions with 29 orders and the highest CVR at 11.07%.

The analysis provides insights into the performance of different marketing channels, helping marketing professionals allocate their budget and resources more effectively to achieve the desired conversion rates and optimize their channel portfolio. It also highlights the importance of tracking and analyzing CVR to assess channel effectiveness.

**Request (November 29, 2012):**

Hi there,

With gsearch doing well and the site performing better, we launched a second paid search channel, bsearch, around August 22. Can you pull weekly trended session volume since then and compare to gsearch nonbrand so I can get a sense for how important this will be for the business?

Thanks,
Tom

**Request Explanation:**

The request from Tom is to analyze the performance of a new paid search channel called "bsearch," which was launched on August 22. Specifically, he wants to understand how the session volume for this new channel compares to the existing "gsearch" nonbrand channel on a weekly basis. This comparison will help Tom gauge the significance of the new channel's impact on the business.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-29'
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(created_at);
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query retrieves weekly trended session volumes for "gsearch" and "bsearch" channels. Here's how it works:

1. The `SELECT` statement selects the minimum date within each week as the `week_start_date`. It also counts the number of distinct sessions for "gsearch" and "bsearch" channels. These session counts are calculated using conditional aggregation.

2. The `FROM` clause specifies the source table as "website_sessions."

3. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to the specified date range, from August 22, 2012, to November 29, 2012, and selects only the records where the campaign is "nonbrand."

4. The results are grouped by the week using the `YEARWEEK` function, which groups sessions by the year and week.

**Answer Table:**

The query provides a table with the following columns and data:

| # week_start_date | gsearch_sessions | bsearch_sessions |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2012-08-22        | 590              | 197              |
| 2012-08-26        | 1056             | 343              |
| 2012-09-02        | 925              | 290              |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table presents a comparison of weekly session volumes between the "gsearch" nonbrand channel and the newly launched "bsearch" channel. Here's the interpretation:

- The "gsearch" channel consistently had a higher number of sessions compared to "bsearch" throughout the period.

- In the early weeks after the launch of "bsearch," "gsearch" had approximately three times as many sessions.

- While "bsearch" experienced growth in sessions over time, it did not surpass "gsearch."

Tom's follow-up comment suggests that "bsearch" tends to receive about one-third of the traffic of "gsearch." This insight is essential for assessing the importance of the new channel and planning future strategies.

Tom also mentions that he will follow up with requests to understand channel characteristics and conversion performance, indicating a deeper analysis of the "bsearch" channel to determine its impact on the business.

The analysis helps provide a clear picture of how the new marketing channel, "bsearch," is performing in terms of session volume compared to the existing "gsearch" channel.

**Request (November 30, 2012):**

Hi there,

I’d like to learn more about the bsearch nonbrand campaign. Could you please pull the percentage of traffic coming on Mobile, and compare that to gsearch? Feel free to dig around and share anything else you find interesting. Aggregate data since August 22nd is great, no need to show trending at this point.

Thanks,
Tom

**Request Explanation:**

Tom's request is to gain a deeper understanding of the "bsearch" nonbrand campaign. Specifically, he wants to know the percentage of website traffic that is coming from mobile devices for this campaign. Additionally, he wants to compare this data to the "gsearch" campaign. Tom encourages the analyst to explore and share any other interesting findings. The analysis should consider data since August 22nd.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    utm_source,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS pct_mobile,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions,
    100 - ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id)) * 100, 2) AS pct_desktop
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-30'
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY utm_source;
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query is designed to analyze and compare the percentage of mobile and desktop traffic for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" nonbrand campaigns. Here's how the query works:

1. The `SELECT` statement includes the `utm_source` (campaign source), total sessions, mobile sessions, the percentage of mobile sessions (`pct_mobile`), desktop sessions, and the percentage of desktop sessions (`pct_desktop`).

2. In the `FROM` clause, data is selected from the "website_sessions" table.

3. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to the specified date range, from August 22, 2012, to November 30, 2012, and selects only the records where the campaign is "nonbrand."

4. The results are grouped by `utm_source` to provide separate statistics for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" campaigns.

**Answer Table:**

The query yields a table with the following columns and data:

| # utm_source | sessions | mobile_sessions | pct_mobile | desktop_sessions | pct_desktop |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| bsearch      | 6522     | 562             | 8.62       | 5960             | 91.38       |
| gsearch      | 20073    | 4921            | 24.52      | 15152            | 75.48       |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table provides insights into the device-specific distribution of traffic for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" nonbrand campaigns. Here's the interpretation:

- **bsearch Campaign:**
  - Total sessions: 6,522
  - Mobile sessions: 562 (8.62% of total sessions)
  - Desktop sessions: 5,960 (91.38% of total sessions)

- **gsearch Campaign:**
  - Total sessions: 20,073
  - Mobile sessions: 4,921 (24.52% of total sessions)
  - Desktop sessions: 15,152 (75.48% of total sessions)

The analysis reveals significant differences in device distribution between the two campaigns. The "gsearch" campaign has a notably higher percentage of mobile sessions compared to the "bsearch" campaign. This insight can be valuable for optimizing marketing strategies and adjusting bids for each campaign based on device-specific performance.

Tom's follow-up comment acknowledges the interesting insights regarding the desktop-to-mobile splits. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing these differences between the channels and suggests that further analysis is needed to optimize bids effectively. Tom expresses his appreciation for the work and encourages continued efforts in this direction.

**Request (December 01, 2012):**

Hi there,

I’m wondering if bsearch nonbrand should have the same bids as gsearch. Could you pull nonbrand conversion rates from session to order for gsearch and bsearch, and slice the data by device type? Please analyze data from August 22 to September 18; we ran a special pre-holiday campaign for gsearch starting on September 19th, so the data after that isn’t fair game.

Thanks,
Tom

**Request Explanation:**

Tom's request is to compare the conversion rates from sessions to orders for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" nonbrand campaigns. He wants this comparison to be segmented by device type. The purpose is to determine if both campaigns should have the same bidding strategy. Tom specifies that the analysis should cover the period from August 22 to September 18, excluding data after September 19 due to a special pre-holiday campaign for "gsearch."

**SQL Query:**

```sql
select a.utm_source, a.device_type, 
count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) as sessions, 
count(DISTINCT b.order_id) as orders,
round((count(DISTINCT b.order_id)/count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id))*100,2) as cvr
from website_sessions a 
left join orders b on b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
where a.created_at between '2012-08-22' AND '2012-09-18'
AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query is designed to calculate and compare conversion rates (CVR) from sessions to orders for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" nonbrand campaigns, while segmenting the data by device type. Here's how the query works:

1. The `SELECT` statement includes the `utm_source` (campaign source), `device_type`, total sessions, total orders, and the conversion rate (`cvr`).

2. In the `FROM` clause, data is selected from the "website_sessions" table, and an outer join with the "orders" table is performed based on the `website_session_id`.

3. The `WHERE` clause filters the data for the specified date range, from August 22, 2012, to September 18, 2012, and ensures that the campaign is "nonbrand."

4. The results are grouped by both `utm_source` and `device_type` to provide detailed conversion rate data for each combination.

**Answer Table:**

The query yields a table with the following columns and data:

| # utm_source | device_type | sessions | orders | cvr  |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|------|
| bsearch      | desktop     | 1118     | 43     | 3.85 |
| bsearch      | mobile      | 125      | 1      | 0.80 |
| gsearch      | desktop     | 2850     | 130    | 4.56 |
| gsearch      | mobile      | 962      | 11     | 1.14 |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table provides conversion rate data for the "bsearch" and "gsearch" nonbrand campaigns, segmented by device type. Here's the interpretation:

- **bsearch Campaign:**
  - Desktop sessions: 1,118
  - Desktop orders: 43
  - Desktop conversion rate (CVR): 3.85%
  - Mobile sessions: 125
  - Mobile orders: 1
  - Mobile conversion rate (CVR): 0.80%

- **gsearch Campaign:**
  - Desktop sessions: 2,850
  - Desktop orders: 130
  - Desktop conversion rate (CVR): 4.56%
  - Mobile sessions: 962
  - Mobile orders: 11
  - Mobile conversion rate (CVR): 1.14%

The analysis clearly shows that the two campaigns have different conversion rates, particularly when considering desktop and mobile devices. The "gsearch" campaign generally outperforms the "bsearch" campaign in terms of conversion rates.

In response to the analysis, Tom acknowledges the differences in performance between the two channels and expresses his intention to adjust the bidding strategy. He plans to bid down the "bsearch" campaign based on its underperformance. This demonstrates the practical implications of the analysis on optimizing the overall paid marketing budget. Tom appreciates the work and encourages further efforts in this direction.

**Request (December 22, 2012):**

Hi there,

Based on your last analysis, we bid down bsearch nonbrand on December 2nd. Can you pull weekly session volume for gsearch and bsearch nonbrand, broken down by device, since November 4th? If you can include a comparison metric to show bsearch as a percent of gsearch for each device, that would be great too.

Thanks,
Tom

**Request Explanation:**

Tom's request is to analyze the weekly session volumes for the "gsearch" and "bsearch" nonbrand campaigns, categorized by device type. This analysis covers the period from November 4th to December 22nd. Additionally, Tom requests a comparison metric that shows "bsearch" as a percentage of "gsearch" for each device type. The purpose is to understand how session volumes changed after they bid down the "bsearch" campaign and assess the impact on the two channels.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
select 
min(date(created_at)) as week_start_date,
count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'desktop' and utm_source = 'gsearch' then website_session_id else null end) as g_dtop_sessions,
count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'desktop' and utm_source = 'bsearch' then website_session_id else null end) as b_dtop_sessions,
round((count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'desktop' and utm_source = 'bsearch' then website_session_id else null end)/count(DISTINCT 
case when device_type = 'desktop' and utm_source = 'gsearch' then website_session_id else null end))*100,2) as b_pct_g_dtop,
count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'mobile' and utm_source = 'gsearch' then website_session_id else null end) as g_mob_sessions,
count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'mobile' and utm_source = 'bsearch' then website_session_id else null end) as b_mob_sessions,
round((count(DISTINCT case when device_type = 'mobile' and utm_source = 'bsearch' then website_session_id else null end)/count(DISTINCT 
case when device_type = 'mobile' and utm_source = 'gsearch' then website_session_id else null end))*100,2) as b_pct_g_mob
from website_sessions
where created_at BETWEEN '2012-11-04' AND '2012-12-22'
AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY yearweek(created_at);
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query aims to calculate and compare weekly session volumes for the "gsearch" and "bsearch" nonbrand campaigns, divided by device type. It also includes a metric showing "bsearch" as a percentage of "gsearch" for each device type. Here's how the query works:

1. The `SELECT` statement includes several calculated fields:
   - `week_start_date`: The earliest date within each week.
   - `g_dtop_sessions`: Count of desktop sessions for "gsearch."
   - `b_dtop_sessions`: Count of desktop sessions for "bsearch."
   - `b_pct_g_dtop`: The percentage of "bsearch" sessions compared to "gsearch" for desktop.
   - `g_mob_sessions`: Count of mobile sessions for "gsearch."
   - `b_mob_sessions`: Count of mobile sessions for "bsearch."
   - `b_pct_g_mob`: The percentage of "bsearch" sessions compared to "gsearch" for mobile.

2. The data is selected from the "website_sessions" table, and conditions are set to filter sessions between November 4, 2012, and December 22, 2012, for the "nonbrand" campaign.

3. The results are grouped by the week's starting date using the `yearweek` function.

**Answer Table:**

The query provides a table with the following columns and data:

| # week_start_date | g_dtop_sessions | b_dtop_sessions | b_pct_g_dtop | g_mob_sessions | b_mob_sessions | b_pct_g_mob |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2012-11-04        | 1027            | 400             | 38.95        | 323            | 29             | 8.98        |
| 2012-11-11        | 956             | 401             | 41.95        | 290            | 37             | 12.76       |
| 2012-11-18        | 2655            | 1008            | 37.97        | 853            | 85             | 9.96        |
| 2012-11-25        | 2058            | 843             | 40.96        | 692            | 62             | 8.96        |
| 2012-12-02        | 1326            | 517             | 38.99        | 396            | 31             | 7.83        |
| 2012-12-09        | 1277            | 293             | 22.94        | 424            | 46             | 10.85       |
| 2012-12-16        | 1270            | 348             | 27.40        | 376            | 41             | 10.90       |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table provides weekly session volume data for "gsearch" and "bsearch" nonbrand campaigns, broken down by device type, along with the percentage of "bsearch" as compared to "gsearch" for each device type. Here's the interpretation:

- **Desktop Sessions:**
  - For the week starting on November 4th, there were 1,027 "gsearch" desktop sessions and 400 "bsearch" desktop sessions, making "bsearch" 38.95% of "gsearch" for desktop.
  - The percentage fluctuates over the weeks but tends to be lower for "bsearch."

- **Mobile Sessions:**
  - For mobile devices, "bsearch" has a much smaller share of sessions compared to "gsearch." The percentage of "bsearch" sessions relative to "gsearch" sessions is considerably lower on mobile.

Tom's comment acknowledges that traffic for both "gsearch" and "bsearch" declined after Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, he notes that "bsearch" experienced a more substantial drop. He considers this to be acceptable, especially given the lower conversion rate for "bsearch." This insight reflects the impact of bid adjustments and provides valuable information for optimizing the marketing strategy. Tom appreciates the work that has been done in this regard.

## Analyzing Direct Traffic
This analysis focuses on evaluating direct traffic sources to gain insights into how well a brand is performing and how effectively it drives business. Direct traffic typically consists of users who directly type in a website's URL, visit from bookmarks, or do not have referral sources. The goal is to categorize and quantify different types of direct traffic, such as organic traffic from specific search engines and other sources.

**Request Explanation:**

The SQL query is designed to categorize and count different types of direct traffic sources and the number of sessions associated with each source. It analyzes website sessions within a specific range of website_session_id values (between 100,000 and 115,000). The traffic sources are categorized into four groups:
1. 'direct_type_in': Users who directly type in the website URL or visit via bookmarks.
2. 'gsearch_organic': Users arriving from 'https://www.gsearch.com' with no specific utm_source, indicating organic traffic from Gsearch.
3. 'bsearch_organic': Users arriving from 'https://www.bsearch.com' with no specific utm_source, indicating organic traffic from Bsearch.
4. 'other': All other sources of direct traffic not falling into the above categories.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
select
    case 
        when http_referer is null then 'direct_type_in'
        when http_referer = 'https://www.gsearch.com' AND utm_source is null then 'gsearch_organic'
        when http_referer = 'https://www.bsearch.com' AND utm_source is null then 'bsearch_organic'
        else 'other'
    end as Traffics,
    count(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions
from website_sessions
where website_session_id between 100000 and 115000
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```

**Query Explanation:**

The SQL query uses a `CASE` statement to categorize the direct traffic based on the criteria explained in the request. Here's how the query works:

- It categorizes the traffic into four types: 'direct_type_in,' 'gsearch_organic,' 'bsearch_organic,' and 'other' based on the conditions defined.
- The data is selected from the "website_sessions" table, and the session IDs are limited to those falling within the specified range (between 100,000 and 115,000).
- The result is grouped by the 'Traffics' categories.
- The final output is ordered by the number of sessions in descending order.

**Answer Table:**

The answer table provides the following data:

| # Traffics      | sessions |
|-----------------|----------|
| other           | 12,760   |
| direct_type_in  | 1,055    |
| gsearch_organic | 966      |
| bsearch_organic | 220      |

**Interpretation of the Answer:**

The answer table shows the count of sessions for different types of direct traffic sources within the specified session ID range. Here's the interpretation:

- 'other': This category has the highest number of sessions, with 12,760 sessions. These are likely visitors who accessed the website through various unspecified direct methods.
- 'direct_type_in': Users who directly typed in the website URL or used bookmarks accounted for 1,055 sessions.
- 'gsearch_organic': There were 966 sessions from users arriving through 'https://www.gsearch.com' with no specific utm_source, indicating organic traffic from Gsearch.
- 'bsearch_organic': Users arriving from 'https://www.bsearch.com' with no specific utm_source contributed 220 sessions, indicating organic traffic from Bsearch.

The analysis provides a breakdown of different types of direct traffic sources, allowing for a better understanding of how users access the website. This information can be valuable for assessing the brand's performance and the effectiveness of various traffic sources.

### Request Explanation:

Cindy is requesting an analysis to understand the trend of different traffic sources by month (organic search, direct type-in, and paid brand search) and their relative percentage concerning paid search nonbrand. The goal is to ascertain if the brand is gaining momentum, particularly in organic, direct, and paid brand searches, and to demonstrate these growth trends as a percentage of the total paid nonbrand traffic.

### SQL Queries:

#### 1. Initial Query for Data Collection:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT utm_source, utm_campaign, http_referer
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-12-23';
```
This query fetches distinct values of 'utm_source', 'utm_campaign', and 'http_referer' from 'website_sessions' created before December 23, 2012, providing insight into various traffic sources.

**ANSWER:**
| # utm_source | utm_campaign | http_referer            |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| gsearch      | nonbrand     | https://www.gsearch.com |
| null         | null         | null                    |
| gsearch      | brand        | https://www.gsearch.com |
| null         | null         | https://www.gsearch.com |
| bsearch      | brand        | https://www.bsearch.com |
| null         | null         | https://www.bsearch.com |
| bsearch      | nonbrand     | https://www.bsearch.com |

#### 2. Channel Categorization Query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
	CASE 
		WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IN ('https://www.gsearch.com', 'https://www.bsearch.com') THEN 'organic_search'
        WHEN utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN 'paid_nonbrand'
        WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN 'paid_brand'
        WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN 'direct_type_in'
	END AS channel_group,
    utm_source,
	utm_campaign,
    http_referer
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE created_at < '2012-12-23';
```
This query categorizes the traffic into different groups ('organic_search', 'paid_nonbrand', 'paid_brand', and 'direct_type_in') based on specific conditions related to 'utm_source', 'utm_campaign', and 'http_referer'.

**ANSWER:**
| # channel_group | utm_source | utm_campaign | http_referer            |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| paid_nonbrand   | gsearch    | nonbrand     | https://www.gsearch.com |
| null            | null       | null         | direct_type_in          |
| paid_brand      | gsearch    | brand        | https://www.gsearch.com |
| organic_search  | null       | null         | https://www.gsearch.com |
| paid_brand      | bsearch    | brand        | https://www.bsearch.com |
| organic_search  | null       | null         | https://www.bsearch.com |
| paid_nonbrand   | bsearch    | nonbrand     | https://www.bsearch.com |

#### 3. Analysis Query for Traffic Sessions by Month:
```sql
WITH cte1 AS (
	SELECT
		website_session_id,
		created_at,
		CASE 
			WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IN ('https://www.gsearch.com', 'https://www.bsearch.com') THEN 'organic_search'
            WHEN utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN 'paid_nonbrand'
            WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN 'paid_brand'
            WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN 'direct_type_in'
		END AS channel_group
	FROM website_sessions 
    WHERE created_at < '2012-12-23'
)
SELECT
	year(created_at) AS yr,
	month(created_at) AS month,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN channel_group = 'paid_nonbrand' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN channel_group = 'paid_brand' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN channel_group = 'paid_brand' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN channel_group = 'paid_nonbrand' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_pct_of_nonbrand,

### Interpretation of the Answer:

The answer table displays the breakdown of various traffic sources by month, illustrating the sessions for each category and their respective percentages concerning the total paid nonbrand sessions.

- For each month of the year 2012, the table includes counts for 'nonbrand,' 'paid_brand,' 'direct,' and 'organic' sessions, along with their proportions in relation to the total 'paid_nonbrand' sessions.
- These columns highlight the absolute growth of different types of sessions over time and demonstrate how each channel contributes as a proportion of the paid nonbrand traffic.
- The growing counts of 'brand,' 'direct,' and 'organic' sessions are depicted in both absolute numbers and their increasing shares in the total 'paid_nonbrand' sessions.

### Comment Explanation by Cindy:

Cindy expresses satisfaction with the analysis results, indicating that the brand, direct, and organic traffic volumes are not only increasing but also growing as a percentage of the paid traffic volume. She mentions this data as an encouraging narrative to present to an investor, suggesting that it portrays positive momentum for the brand's organic and direct traffic, showcasing potential growth beyond reliance solely on paid traffic.

## ANALYZING SEASONALITY & BUSINESS PATTERNS
The SQL query is designed to analyze business patterns, specifically focusing on the time and date of website sessions. It extracts information such as the session ID, the date and time of the session, the hour of the day, the day of the week, the quarter, the month, the date, and the week number for a range of website session IDs. This data can help in understanding the patterns and trends in website traffic, which is valuable for optimizing efficiency and anticipating future business trends.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
select 
	website_session_id, 
    created_at, 
    hour(created_at) as hr,
    weekday(created_at) as wkday,
    case 
		when weekday(created_at) = 0 then 'Monday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 1 then 'Tuesday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 2 then 'Wednesday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 3 then 'Thursday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 4 then 'Friday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 5 then 'Saturday'
        when weekday(created_at) = 6 then 'Sunday'
        else 'other_day'
	end as clean_weekday,
    quarter(created_at) as qtr,
    month(created_at) as month,
    date(created_at) as date,
    week(created_at) as wk
from website_sessions
where website_session_id between 150000 and 155000;
```

**Explanation:**
- The query selects specific columns from the `website_sessions` table and calculates additional attributes based on the `created_at` timestamp.
- `hour(created_at) as hr` extracts the hour of the day from the timestamp.
- `weekday(created_at) as wkday` calculates the numeric day of the week (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday).
- The `case` statement transforms the numeric day of the week into a human-readable format, such as 'Monday,' 'Tuesday,' etc., and assigns it to the column `clean_weekday`.
- `quarter(created_at) as qtr` extracts the quarter from the timestamp.
- `month(created_at) as month` gets the month.
- `date(created_at) as date` retrieves the date.
- `week(created_at) as wk` calculates the week number of the year.

This query is applied to a specific range of `website_session_id` values between 150000 and 155000, presumably to focus the analysis on a specific subset of website sessions.

**Answer Table:**

| # website_session_id | created_at          | hr | wkday | clean_weekday | qtr | month | date       | wk |

It provides information on the session ID, the timestamp, the hour of the day, the day of the week, the day of the week in a more readable format, the quarter, the month, the date, and the week number for each session.

**Interpretation:**
The query generates a dataset that can be used for analyzing business patterns. It helps in understanding how website traffic varies by different time-related attributes, such as hour, day of the week, and more. This information can be valuable for identifying trends and optimizing business operations based on the patterns observed in the data.

**Request Date: January 02, 2013**

**Request by Cindy:**
Good morning,
2012 was a great year for us. As we continue to grow, we should take a look at 2012’s monthly and weekly volume patterns, to see if we can find any seasonal trends we should plan for in 2013.
If you can pull session volume and order volume, that would be excellent.
Thanks,
-Cindy

**SQL Query:**
```sql
select year(a.created_at) as yr, 
month(a.created_at) as month,
count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) as sessions,
count(DISTINCT b.order_id) as orders
from website_sessions a
left join orders b on b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
where a.created_at < '2013-01-01'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

**Explanation:**
- The query is designed to provide an analysis of monthly volume patterns for the year 2012 by counting the number of website sessions and orders.
- It selects the year and month from the `created_at` timestamp, calculates the number of unique website sessions (sessions), and the number of unique orders (orders).
- The data is obtained from the `website_sessions` table and the `orders` table, with a LEFT JOIN based on the common key `website_session_id`.
- The data is filtered to include only records with a `created_at` date before January 1, 2013.
- The results are grouped by year and month, providing a summary of monthly session and order volumes for 2012.

**Answer Table:**
| # yr | month | sessions | orders |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 2012 | 3     | 1879     | 60     |
| 2012 | 4     | 3734     | 99     |
| 2012 | 5     | 3736     | 108    |
| 2012 | 6     | 3963     | 140    |
| 2012 | 7     | 4249     | 169    |

## Product Sales Analysis
This SQL query is designed for product sales analysis. Analyzing product sales is crucial for businesses to understand the performance of each product, how they contribute to overall revenue, and how product launches affect the product portfolio. In this specific case, the analysis focuses on sales of primary products within a range of order IDs (between 10000 and 11000). The query retrieves key metrics, including the number of orders, total revenue, margin, and average revenue for each primary product.

**Request Explanation:**
The request for this SQL query is to obtain insights into product sales within the specified order ID range. It aims to identify the performance of each primary product by analyzing order counts, total revenue, margin, and the average revenue per order for products within this range.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
select 
 primary_product_id,
 count(order_id) as orders,
 sum(price_usd) as revenue,
 sum(price_usd - cogs_usd) as margin,
 avg(price_usd) as average_revenue
 from orders 
 where order_id between 10000 and 11000
 group by 1
 order by 4 desc;
```

**Explanation:**
- The SQL query begins with a `SELECT` statement that retrieves specific information for analysis.
- It selects the `primary_product_id` to identify the product, and then aggregates data for each product by using several aggregate functions.
- The `COUNT` function counts the number of orders for each product, `SUM` calculates the total revenue for each product, and `SUM(price_usd - cogs_usd)` computes the margin by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue.
- The `AVG` function calculates the average revenue per order for each product.
- The data used for analysis is filtered using a `WHERE` clause, which restricts it to orders with order IDs between 10000 and 11000.
- The results are grouped by `primary_product_id` and ordered in descending order based on the margin.

**Answer Table:**

| # primary_product_id | orders | revenue  | margin   | average_revenue |
|----------------------|--------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1                    | 731    | 42009.62 | 25900.00 | 57.468700       |

**Request (January 04, 2013):**  
Cindy has requested a deep dive analysis into the company's current flagship product to prepare for the upcoming launch of a new product. Specifically, she asks for monthly trends in sales, total revenue, and total margin generated by the business. The goal is to establish baseline data that will help in tracking the evolution of revenue and margin as the new product is introduced. This analysis will also provide insights into the company's overall growth pattern.

**SQL Query:**  
```sql
select year(created_at) as year,
month(created_at) as month,
count(DISTINCT order_id) as number_of_sales,
sum(price_usd) as total_revenue,
sum(price_usd - cogs_usd) as total_margin
from orders
where created_at < '2013-01-04'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

**Explanation:**  
- The SQL query begins with a `SELECT` statement to extract relevant data for analysis.
- It selects the `year` and `month` from the `created_at` timestamp to organize the data into monthly intervals.
- The query calculates key metrics for each month:
  - `number_of_sales`: Counts the number of distinct order IDs to determine the total sales for the flagship product during each month.
  - `total_revenue`: Sums the total revenue generated by the product for each month.
  - `total_margin`: Computes the total margin for each month by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the total revenue.
- The data used for analysis is filtered using a `WHERE` clause. It includes only orders created before January 4, 2013, providing historical data up to that point.
- The results are then grouped by the year and month using `GROUP BY`, allowing for the calculation of monthly trends.

**Answer Table:**  

| # year | month | number_of_sales | total_revenue | total_margin |
|--------|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 2012   | 3     | 60              | 2999.40       | 1830.00      |

| 2012   | 10    | 371             | 18546.29      | 11315.50     |
| 2012   | 11    | 618             | 30893.82      | 18849.00     |
| 2012   | 12    | 506             | 25294.94      | 15433.00     |

The answer table displays the historical data regarding the flagship product's performance in terms of number of sales, total revenue, and total margin, organized on a monthly basis.

**Interpretation:**  
The analysis presents monthly trends for the flagship product up to January 4, 2013. It shows a consistent pattern of growth throughout the year 2012, with the number of sales, total revenue, and total margin increasing over time. This historical data serves as valuable baseline information, enabling the company to monitor how revenue and margin evolve following the launch of the new product.

Cindy's comment expresses her satisfaction with the provided data, emphasizing its importance as a baseline for tracking the impact of the new product. She also appreciates the insight into the company's overall growth pattern, which can inform future business strategies and decision-making.

**Request (April 05, 2013):**  
Cindy has requested a trended analysis for the period since April 1, 2013, following the launch of the company's second product on January 6th. She seeks insights into several key performance indicators to assess the impact of this new product. The analysis includes monthly order volume, overall conversion rates, revenue per session, and a breakdown of sales by product.

**SQL Query:**  
```sql
select 
	year(a.created_at) as year,
    month(a.created_at) as month,
    count(DISTINCT b.order_id) as orders,
    count(distinct b.order_id)/count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) as cvr,
    round(sum(b.price_usd)/count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id),2) as revenue_sessions,
    count(distinct case when b.primary_product_id = 1 then order_id else null end) as product_one_orders,
    count(distinct case when b.primary_product_id = 2 then order_id else null end) as product_two_orders
    
from website_sessions a 
left join orders b on b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
where a.created_at between '2012-04-01' AND '2013-04-05'
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

**Explanation:**  
- The SQL query begins with a `SELECT` statement to extract and calculate relevant metrics for analysis.
- It selects the `year` and `month` from the `created_at` timestamp to group the data into monthly intervals.
- The query counts the number of distinct order IDs as `orders`, which represents the monthly order volume.
- It calculates the conversion rate (`cvr`) by dividing the count of distinct order IDs by the count of distinct website sessions, providing an overall conversion rate for each month.
- The revenue per session (`revenue_sessions`) is calculated by dividing the sum of `price_usd` by the count of distinct website sessions. The result is rounded to two decimal places.
- Two additional columns provide a breakdown of sales by product. The count of distinct order IDs is calculated for each product ID, representing `product_one_orders` and `product_two_orders`.

- The data used for analysis is filtered using a `WHERE` clause. It includes records created between April 1, 2012, and April 5, 2013, aligning with Cindy's request for data since April 1, 2013.
- The results are then grouped by the year and month, allowing for the calculation of monthly trends.

The answer table presents the trended analysis for monthly order volume, conversion rates, revenue per session, and sales by product, spanning from April 2012 to April 2013.

**Interpretation:**  
The analysis reveals the following insights:
- Conversion rates (`cvr`) have been steadily improving over time, from approximately 2.65% in April 2012 to around 6.11% in January 2013.
- Revenue per session (`revenue_sessions`) has also shown a positive trend, increasing from $1.33 per session in April 2012 to $3.13 per session in January 2013.
- The breakdown of sales by product shows that product one dominated the sales until January 2013, after which product two started contributing significantly.

Cindy's comment expresses her satisfaction with the analysis results, particularly regarding the improvements in conversion rates and revenue per session over time. However, she raises a valid question about whether the growth observed since January is primarily due to the new product's launch or part of the company's ongoing business improvements. To address this question, she plans to connect with Tom to conduct a more detailed analysis.
