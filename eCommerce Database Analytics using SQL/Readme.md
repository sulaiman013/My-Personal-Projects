# Introduction

I've recently joined Maven Fuzzy Factory as an eCommerce Database Analyst, where I'm part of the startup team working closely with the CEO, Head of Marketing, and Website Manager. Our primary focus is to navigate the online retail space, analyze marketing channels, optimize website performance, and measure the impact of our new product launches.

# Data Information

Our database plays a pivotal role in our analysis and decision-making processes. It consists of six key tables:

1. **website_sessions**: This table holds essential information about website sessions, including details like session duration, user source, campaign, device type, and referral sources.

2. **website_pageviews**: Here, we store data related to website page views, tracking user activity across our web pages.

3. **products**: This table is dedicated to our product catalog, containing valuable data about our products, including their names and creation dates.

4. **orders**: We keep track of all customer orders in this table, capturing data on order IDs, website sessions, user IDs, primary products, items purchased, prices, and costs.

5. **order_items**: Each order can consist of multiple items, and this table stores the details of these items, such as product IDs, prices, and costs.

6. **order_item_refunds**: In case of any refunds, we meticulously record refund data here, including refund amounts and their associations with orders and items.

As we dive deeper into the data, my goal is to become the data expert for Maven Fuzzy Factory, providing mission-critical analyses that help drive our business forward and achieve our goals.
