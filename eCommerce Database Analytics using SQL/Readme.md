# Introduction

I've recently joined Maven Fuzzy Factory as an eCommerce Database Analyst, where I'm part of the startup team working closely with the CEO, Head of Marketing, and Website Manager. Our primary focus is to navigate the online retail space, analyze marketing channels, optimize website performance, and measure the impact of our new product launches.

# Data Information

Our database plays a pivotal role in our analysis and decision-making processes. It consists of six key tables:

1. **website_sessions**: This table holds essential information about website sessions, including details like session duration, user source, campaign, device type, and referral sources.

2. **website_pageviews**: Here, we store data related to website page views, tracking user activity across our web pages.

3. **products**: This table is dedicated to our product catalog, containing valuable data about our products, including their names and creation dates.

4. **orders**: We keep track of all customer orders in this table, capturing data on order IDs, website sessions, user IDs, primary products, items purchased, prices, and costs.

5. **order_items**: Each order can consist of multiple items, and this table stores the details of these items, such as product IDs, prices, and costs.

6. **order_item_refunds**: In case of any refunds, we meticulously record refund data here, including refund amounts and their associations with orders and items.

As we dive deeper into the data, my goal is to become the data expert for Maven Fuzzy Factory, providing mission-critical analyses that help drive our business forward and achieve our goals.

## Traffic Source Analysis

In the realm of eCommerce, understanding where your customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic is paramount. This analysis focuses on leveraging the UTM parameters stored in our database to identify paid website sessions and determine the revenue generated by these paid campaigns.

**1. Identifying Traffic Sources**

We commence by exploring the size of various traffic sources, primarily examining the UTM content that drives the most sessions within the specified dataset range.

```sql
SELECT utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM   website_sessions
WHERE  website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions |
|-------------|----------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      |
| null        | 18       |
| g_ad_2      | 6        |
| b_ad_2      | 2        |

In this context, 'g_ad_1' stands out as the dominant traffic source, driving 975 sessions. Null entries are also present, representing traffic without specific UTM content, totaling 18 sessions. Additionally, 'g_ad_2' and 'b_ad_2' contribute smaller session counts.

**2. Linking Traffic Sources to Orders**

Next, we expand our analysis to link these traffic sources to orders, gaining insights into how effectively these sources convert sessions into actual orders.

```sql
SELECT a.utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id) AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)           AS orders
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY a.utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions | orders |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      | 35     |
| null        | 18       | 0      |
| g_ad_2      | 6        | 0      |
| b_ad_2      | 2        | 0      |

Unsurprisingly, 'g_ad_1' still leads in sessions with 975, contributing 35 orders. However, it's notable that 'null,' 'g_ad_2,' and 'b_ad_2' did not result in any orders during this period.

**3. Session-to-Order Conversion Rate**

To provide a comprehensive view, we calculate the session-to-order conversion rate for each traffic source.

```sql
SELECT a.utm_content,
       Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id)    AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)              AS orders,
       Round(( Count(DISTINCT b.order_id) / Count(DISTINCT
             a.website_session_id) ) * 100, 2) AS sess_ord_conv_rate
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.website_session_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000
GROUP  BY a.utm_content
ORDER  BY sessions DESC;
```

**Result:**

| utm_content | sessions | orders | sess_ord_conv_rate |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| g_ad_1      | 975      | 35     | 3.59               |
| null        | 18       | 0      | 0.00               |
| g_ad_2      | 6        | 0      | 0.00               |
| b_ad_2      | 2        | 0      | 0.00               |

When assessing the session-to-order conversion rates, 'g_ad_1' shows a rate of 3.59%. The other sources, including 'null,' 'g_ad_2,' and 'b_ad_2,' did not yield any conversions during this analyzed period.

In summary, this analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of various traffic sources in driving sessions and orders, with 'g_ad_1' being the most significant contributor to both sessions and orders. Understanding these conversion rates is crucial for optimizing our marketing strategies and improving the overall business performance.

**Analysis of Website Sessions â€“ UTM Source Breakdown**

**Request Explanation:**
Cindy, the date requested is April 12, 2012. The objective is to gain insights into the bulk of website sessions leading up to that date, specifically focusing on the breakdown by UTM source, campaign, and referring domain if available.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
select utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer, count(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions
from website_sessions
where created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer
ORDER BY sessions DESC;
```

**SQL Query Explanation:**

1. `select utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer, count(DISTINCT website_session_id) as sessions`: This part of the query selects the relevant columns from the `website_sessions` table, including UTM content, UTM campaign, HTTP referer, and calculates the count of distinct website session IDs, which represents the number of sessions.

2. `from website_sessions`: It specifies the source table from which the data is retrieved, which is the `website_sessions` table.

3. `where created_at < '2012-04-12'`: This clause filters the data based on the `created_at` column, ensuring that only records with a creation date before April 12, 2012, are included in the analysis.

4. `GROUP BY utm_content, utm_campaign, http_referer`: This clause groups the data by UTM content, UTM campaign, and HTTP referer, allowing for a breakdown of sessions by these parameters.

5. `ORDER BY sessions DESC`: The results are then ordered in descending order based on the number of sessions, with the most significant number of sessions appearing first in the output.

**Result:**

| utm_content | utm_campaign | http_referer            | sessions |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|----------|
| g_ad_1      | nonbrand     | https://www.gsearch.com | 3613     |
|             |              |                         | 28       |
|             |              | https://www.gsearch.com | 27       |
| g_ad_2      | brand        | https://www.gsearch.com | 26       |
|             | 7            | https://www.bsearch.com |          |
| b_ad_2      | brand        | https://www.bsearch.com | 7        |

**Interpretation:**

The provided data showcases a comprehensive breakdown of website sessions, sorted by UTM source, campaign, and referring domain. It's apparent that 'g_ad_1' nonbrand sessions from 'https://www.gsearch.com' dominate with 3613 sessions. Notably, there are several entries with null values for UTM content and campaign, which collectively contribute 28 sessions.

**Follow-up:**

As we observe the dominance of 'g_ad_1' nonbrand sessions, it is advisable to conduct a more detailed analysis of this particular source to identify optimization opportunities. To gain further insights and establish next steps, involving Tom for his expertise is a practical course of action.

**Request:**

Tom wants to determine the conversion rate (CVR) from website sessions to orders, specifically focusing on sessions generated through the "gsearch" source with a "nonbrand" campaign. The goal is to calculate whether the CVR meets the minimum threshold of 4% needed to make the financial numbers work. If the CVR is below this threshold, adjustments to reduce search bids might be necessary. Tom's request aims to evaluate the economic viability of their paid search campaigns.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT Count(DISTINCT a.website_session_id)    AS sessions,
       Count(DISTINCT b.order_id)              AS orders,
       Round(( Count(DISTINCT b.order_id) / Count(DISTINCT
             a.website_session_id) ) * 100, 2) AS CVR
FROM   website_sessions a
       LEFT JOIN orders b
              ON b.website_session_id = a.website_session_id
WHERE  a.created_at < '2012-04-14' 
       AND utm_source = "gsearch"
       AND utm_campaign = "nonbrand"
ORDER  BY 3 DESC; 
```

**SQL Query Explanation:**
- The query calculates the CVR by counting the number of distinct website sessions and orders.
- It computes the CVR by dividing the number of orders by the number of sessions and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.
- The query filters data based on the "gsearch" source and "nonbrand" campaign to focus on sessions from this specific marketing channel.
- Results are sorted in descending order based on the CVR.

**Answer:**
| # sessions | orders | CVR  |
|------------|--------|------|
| 3895       | 112    | 2.88 |

**Answer Interpretation:**
The analysis shows that the CVR for sessions generated through the "gsearch" source with a "nonbrand" campaign is approximately 2.88%. This CVR falls short of the 4% threshold needed to make the economics work for the paid search campaigns. Consequently, there is a need to reduce search bids since the current conversion rate indicates that they are over-spending.

**Comment by Tom:**
Tom acknowledges the analysis and mentions that, based on the findings, they need to dial down their search bids. The reason for this is that they are currently over-spending on their campaigns due to the lower-than-desired conversion rate. The analysis has helped them make more cost-effective decisions and saved them money.

**Request:**
The request is to analyze traffic sources and bid optimization based on website sessions and orders data. The goal is to understand the value of different segments of paid traffic for bid optimization.
